# OnlineComment_Analysis_Fiat_2023 (April/2023 - Sep/2023)
An online comment NLP analysis based on Topic Model & Sentiment Analysis regarding Fiat electrification
## Acknowledgement
The research project within this repo was conducted by Chuqiao Xiao, which is based on one of the working branches of the Bayes (Cass) Business School MSc Business Analytics 2023 graduation group project by Team Abarth_1
## Data Source
SpeakEV - an online forum for EV (electric vehicle) enthusiasts
## Research Objectives & Approaches
The project aims to understand how online customer perceptions on EV topics evolve over time. The focus of the project is to compare how customer perceptions differ before & after an EV model was launched.

- In the 1st phase the online comments were scrapped by Python; 

- In the 2nd phase the NLP technologies were applied to process data then output the model results; 

- In the 3rd phase the results were visualised through both Python and PowerBI; 

- In the last phase the results & visualisations were analysed and insights were concluded

**Scrapping packages used**: Selenium, BeautifulSoup

**NLP technologies & packages used**: Text Preprocessing - SpaCy, Topic Modelling - Gensim, Sentiment Analysis - Transformers (models from Hugging Face)

**BI tools**: Matplotlib, PowerBI
## Research Objects (Brands)
Online discussions regarding EVs by Fiat, Peugeot, Tesla, Mini, Volkswagen
## Research Results & Suggestions
- It’s recognised that customers are getting more interested in EV characteristics (e.g., battery, driving range, charging facilities) in recent years. It's suggested that Fiat Abarth focus on elaborating how their techs on these electric features develop and get improved on their websites and in their showcases.
- Customers can be sensitive to EV prices. The advise to Fiat Abarth is that the company breakdown EV ownership costs to increase buyer trust and clarity. Alternatively, take a price reduction strategy or offer discounts to customers during the first 3 months after the car was released.
- Some competitors’ strategies on developing intelligent systems and car automation intrigue customers’ interests, suggesting a future R&D direciton to Fiat Abarth.
- Customer perceptions on some granular EV features remain unclear.
