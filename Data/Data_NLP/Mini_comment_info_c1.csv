Really more efficient to build in China and export to the EU? Doubt it very much however if their biggest market is China who are huge buyers of electric then undoubtedly it will be more efficient for cars destined for China.
Seems to me the whole issue now with the U.K. is the lack of investment in the essential infrastructure like gigwatt factories (thinking of the difficulties of Britishvolt and the loss of the Tesla factory) where it is starting to fall seriously behind plus the self imposed barriers of exporting to a large market. I doubt very much BMW will return electric cars to the U.K. and this is a sad and worrying decision for the U.K. industry. Everyone is scrabbling to attract investment to their countries and bring production home sadly the U.K. has no own home owned mass producer of cars. All the big players are owned by companies not ultimately based in the U.K., Nissan is Japanese, Jaguar LandRover are Indian, Stelliantos are French, BMW german all being enticed to go elsewhere or bring production to their home markets as in the case of Stelliantos.

Hi

I had my Ohme charger installed last week and there is no API link between it and the Mini at the moment. It would be worth contacting them to lobby for them to add the Mini.

I'm now on Octopus Go. I have connected this tariff to the Ohme and set a cap of 5p per kwhr so it only charges between 00:30 and 04:30. I set the Ohme schedule to add 75 miles and just plug it in and forget about it. The charging does normally stop before the 75 miles is added as the battery is full. The Mini is able to start charging when the Ohme schedule kicks in, so largely working ok.

I received the following reply from Ohme today:

""Hi Steve,

Thanks for getting in touch.

We are not yet integrated with the MINI API, but our Dev Team are working on it.

You will still be able to benefit from all of Ohme's smart charging capabilities but without API support, using Ohme is slightly different. Instead of using Charge Schedules to specify what state of charge you would like the battery to be in at the end of the charge session, you will need to create Charge Schedules that specify how many miles you would like to add to the current range. So if your weekday commute is 50 miles, then you could create a Charge Schedule which says ‚Äúadd 50 miles range by 7am on weekdays‚Äù.

When using Ohme without an API, it is quite common for the car to become ‚Äúfull‚Äù halfway through a charge session, and Ohme may send an alert to tell you that the car is not charging as expected.



Best wishes,
Lily

Good question and one that I have been experimenting with myself. 

In my experience (5,000 miles in my Mini since January) I think if you are looking for economy on a journey, or maintaining battery charge for any length of time you have gotten the wrong car ! 

EV only range is poor, bordering on rubbish for a current generation PHEV and the fuel tank is as big as a thimble so with the gasoline engine being far from efficient, getting good economy on a journey of greater than 100 miles whilst trying to maintain any kind of battery life is really difficult.... the negatives aside my findings on driving modes vs. fuel use + electric use so far have been:

In MAX E Drive - you can get slightly better range out of the battery and the ICE in GREEN mode than in MID mode. 

Don't expect more than 18 miles EV range in normal mixed urban driving with any kind of gradient ever and the difference between GREEN and MID has only ever been ""around"" 2 miles EV range in MAX E Drive despite any driving style changes I can do. I haven't had the vehicle long enough to understand how temperature affects things though, so maybe an extra mile by the summer may be possible ? 

The same goes for EV only range in AUTO E Drive, but you must keep the speed below 55mph (ish) or the gasoline engine kicks in.... The gasoline kicks in at a higher vehicle speed in MAX E Drive 

Don't run in SPORT, don't use the S function of the transmission and don't manually shift - all of these blunts total range (battery + ICE) by as much as 20 miles on my ""standard"" 300 mile there and back commute - I have tried all three variants from a full battery and in AUTO E Drive on my weekly 300 mile (in one day) commute and the 20 mile swing is ""real"" (or as real as I can standardise things based on trying to maintain my driving style, the same route, same time of day and speeds etc). 

So far, the best vehicle setup for getting the best MPG I have found (on a brim-2-brim and cross referencing to the App and the MFD in the car) is to start with a full battery, then transmission in D, GREEN and AUTO E Drive and let the car do the rest. Electric consumption is difficult to monitor /measure for me as I only have the cars MFD to go on. I cheaped out on my home charger and cant yet differentiate household electric use vs. charging my car electric use, but I have been keeping a record or when I charge and what the battery SOC is at the start of the charging session (from the vehicles MFD) so if I ever get the time one day I might try and calculate my total electric consumption for the vehicle.

Running in SAVE mode gives horrendous ICE fuel economy at the time of driving, but does allow you to drive in Zero Emissions mode in the last couple of miles, so you can feel better about not polluting your own town as you drive home in the evening - but that is just ""kicking the can down the road"" as you are using more gasoline prior to that part of your journey to try and recover EV only range.

MAX E Drive with MID is great for journeys of under 12 miles if you want to drive ""with spirit"" (but don't ever go WOT as the gasoline engine kicks in !) or upto 16 miles if you drive like you have eggs under the throttle, but I cant find any journey to really stretch my battery range in this setup..... the ultimate is to find a route that starts and finishes at the same point, but is only ever down a 20% gradient, so you benefit from full regen on the overrun without the car grinding itself to a halt - so if you do find that piece of road, please let me know where it is 

MAX E Drive with GREEN is the best use of EV only power (with eggs under the throttle) I have found and have managed a maximum of 18 miles once like that. 

I have experimented also with capping my speed (never exceed 65mph in any mode and trying to stick to 60mph where the roads allow) and basically trying to drive everywhere on the overrun. Its boring but I have seen late 50's MPG on the brim-2-brim / vehicle MFD and App (all within 5% of each other) and using a full battery charge in the aforementioned AUTO E Drive + D + GREEN...... 

I think if you really try hard - on a long journey - you should be able to get down to as low as 34-35 MPG from the ICE and using your full battery, but from experience I think its down to the individual driver to tailor the MPG vs. Driving pleasure vs. Journey time trade offs..... 

If you get a home charger (whilst the grants still exist) and try to persuade your employer to install a charger at your office, you should get reasonable MPG figures, but I don't think you will find a good compromise to get most battery and fuel use from this car.....",1,0.0

You are right about sport mode.
When the battery is below 50% it charges very aggressively. This can leave you with mpg in the low 30‚Äôs or worse.
When above 55% it stops charging so you effectively just use the ICE with electrical support. This leads to mid forties for me.

I do wish you could adjust auto edrive. I‚Äôd like a mode that uses the ICE more but still uses some battery power. AutoEdrive is basically battery only unless you accelerate hard or reach 55mph.
Why can‚Äôt I. Change that to 30% throttle and 30mph?

Save mode is economical when the battery is above 90% staying in the mid forties. When under 90% it is charging and yields about 37 mpg.

I have had some success with using autoEdrive for a 3 mile trip out then sport mode(manual) for the trip back.

I tend to just let the car ""do its thing"" for any short journeys (around 15-16 miles maximum which is basically all I do unless I'm going down to the office or out to see clients) - Which is a default of MAX E Drive and MID. 

I quite like the relaxed driving style it gives and the ""dull"" throttle response is perfect for keeping up with all the traffic I find in town and on single A Roads. I don't think I could be bothered to try and ""tailor"" a mode myself 

Would certainly be interested in learning more of your experiences with eeking out the best fuel economy of the ICE (and getting the most total range on the battery). My mileage rate from my company is quite low (15ppm) but so far in the 3500+ business miles I have done in the car I have averaged close to 52mpg, so i'm quite happy. 

That ""nearly 52mpg"" does include starting every business trip on a full tank of electric - so slightly masking the ICE figures. I only ever charge on my E7 rate which is less than 10p/kW.h so around 65p for a charge. 

I think I'm 'winning' on the business miles vs. cost stakes, but I do long for the heady days of 75mpg+ and a range of over 800 miles from my old Diesel......

With a fuel tank the size of a thimble and 2x AAA batteries under the back seat, if I ""drive it like I stole it"" - I wouldn't get home ! If the best EV range you can hope to achieve in the next 5 years is only 450 miles with a 4hr + recharge time then god help us all.......

And as a very wise man once said - ""If something seems too good to be true, then it probably IS too good to be true"" 

I'll be honest with you, getting 82mpg for the 25 mile round trip is quite good going.... the 30mpg for the 12.5 mile return portion sounds worse than when I ran my 24V V6 Alfa 164 back in the day though !! 

Did you ""modify"" your driving style ? ie. Did you drive it like you would have done your last ICE engine car or did you drive it like you were trying to save fuel / electric ??

I can totally see how people get carried away with the ""I got over 350mpg !!! Woohooo"" agenda, but its just not real.... My last company VW averaged 68mpg for the whole of its life with me (45,000 miles) - that included the weekends and short runs as well as the autoroute cruises... and that was an Auto !

I have been logging Brim-2-Brim as well and have seen as low as 42mpg between fills and as high as 84mpg ! So I think this is about ""normal"" - based on a sample size of just us two ! - I think I am averaging (Brim-2-Brim figures) just over 50mpg since getting the car in January.

Firstly, you generally dont rapid charge back to 100%. Charging slows significantly above 80% and its almost never worth taking it past 90.

Secondly, you never run it down to 0%, because you always want to keep a bit of a buffer to get to an alternative charger etc. Depending on route that buffer might even be 10 or 15miles of range at the bottom end.

Thus while the car might have ""100miles"" of range, you need to stop after 80miles the first time, and then because you've only charged to 80%, your subsequent stops are closer together still.

Lastly, the chargers never quite line up where you need them, so you might find you have 80miles of range, but the chargers are either 70miles, or 90miles away. Clearly you end up having to stop at 70miles instead.


I also suspect that 100miles in winter is not actually realistic for a car with <30kwh of energy, and certainly not if your trying to do 75mph.

My experience is that AirCon in hot weather has a bigger impact on range than keeping the cabin warm in cold weather. 

In cold weather the loss from heating is less significant because the cabin heating will be from waste heat from the motor, inverter and battery which is used to head the cabin via the heat pump.

Using Green+ mode in the winter will be very uncomfortable, even with cabin pre-conditioning.

On road trips we have always planned our first charging stop at 100miles and subsequent stops at 80 miles. The longest trip was Worcester to Cornwall with two <30min stops.

The Mini SE is not a 'road trip car', but the extra travelling times for a 200-300m UK journey is not significant for leisure trips especially if AC charging is available at the destination site.

I believe that the only scheduled part replacements within a 3 or 4 year PCP or lease period is the cabin air filter.

Tyres and wiper blades would get changed if worn but this is mileage and climate dependent.

The ICE mini is a hoot to drive , even the lower spec models, however the extra weight of batteries etc may have compromised this in the Countryman.

We had the 225xe (same running gear) and it managed my wife's 10 mile commute as an EV every day.

Its USP over other PHEVs was the EV drove the rear, and the ICE drove the front wheels.

So 4wd when required and rapid performance without wheelspin.

As a long range cruiser it would manage 40-45mpg once the battery was low which isn't great but competitive with any other sub-7sec to 60 MPV that isn't a diesel.

What is ‚Äúpremium‚Äù?

I find BMW‚Äôs have a harsh ride, MINI even worse, nice interiors as a rule, but very dear parts and servicing.

VW not proving very reliable at the moment...... so define premium, it‚Äôs about perception and how you see things....

You would get a top spec Niro PHEV with sensible mileage, 7 year warranty, 35-40m EV only range, and about 75 mpg after that driven sensibly.....

I had one before the current Soul and over 12 months averaged 170 mpg plus

My daily commute is 14m so it did work and back comfortably on battery, I have to collect my kids (women each way) so it did there and half way back on battery, and the odd long trip (60-70mpg motorway and 80mpg + in the town)

Radar cruise, heated leather seats, and as said before, 7 years warranty...... gotta be a good choice.

On what basis are second hand GTEs 'not very reliable at the moment'?

From my experience of the ICE Mini and the GTE the handling is just fine, particularly if you wish to 'make progress'.

There is a comparative test of Countryman and phev Niro here - for me the mini wins as more fun to drive - 'light and lifeless steering' seems to be a common trait with many new cars.

The handling is excellent - it‚Äôs the ride that‚Äôs worse than awful!

It‚Äôs horses for courses - I like a comfy car so would never buy a Mini in. A million years. I think the Countryman is a bit better - but why bother with a PHEV if it only gives such a poor EV range - better save a wad of cash and just buy a small engine petrol, or a Diesel if you mainly do long trips...

If you found the ride in a Mini as 'worse than awful' then there must have been something wrong with the one you drove. Having driven one for a few thousand miles (everything from long motorway trips to hacking around country lanes) and it was fine. If the OP has any concerns then a test drive will confirm.

Whilst second hand prices are crazy at the moment I personally would not pay ¬£15k for a car with over 100k miles on it. There seem to be few if any Countryman on the market at that price point, but GTEs and A3s are available with 30k miles less for that price. 

Still a lot of money, and if it were me I would probably hold off on a purchase if possible until some sense has returned to the market (probably 1 to 2 years away).",1,3149998.0

All down to your personal circumstances, but if it were me I would probably favour using the ¬£15k as a contribution towards a more expensive car (whether using it to fund a PCP deal for 2.5 years as you suggest or topping up with a personal loan).

A newer / lower mileage Countryman / Golf GTE / A3 would be lower risk, or maybe a higher budget would would open up some fun EV options.

I had a countryman PHEV for over 3 years now. First, beware there are two versions, the original and the newer one (around 2019 model year) which has a slightly bigger battery so it could still qualify as exempt for the London congestion charge (the original version no longer qualifies), and I believe it also has the option to add a SIM card for real-time traffic updates if you use the native GPS (which I don't, I just use google maps on Apple car play). It is quite a comfortable vehicle but not without its problems, e.g. it isn't Android compatible but has Apple car play. It's a cushy drive, nothing at all like the e-Mini which is harsh (I felt sick on test drive!). If you are just driving around locally then it is OK, nothing exciting but nice. It is best used as a local runaround / local commuter with very occasional longer journeys, it has a very small fuel tank to make space for the battery, and if you use if for longer journeys not only is it relatively inefficient because it is hauling around the weight of two entire drivetrains, and you also have to stop to fill it up frequently. On the other hand, 60,000 miles in and it has not required any work done on it whatsoever except tyres and wiper blades, which when you consider how complex this car is with the two drivetrains working together, is pretty amazing. If you have a drive at home to charge it on then it is very nice for cold weather commuting as you can set the climate control to warm the car up for you in the morning which is great. However, last time I checked the app was pretty useless so you can't just manually pre-condition it from your phone, you have to set it in the car. It fits my life so I have kept hold of it, but if you are doing regular long journey of over say 50 miles each way I would not recommend it as the fuel efficiency is poor.",2,0.0

Due to internal politics there's a few dealers that can't/won't work with each other to help you out, and if it's at Park Lane then you have almost no chance of getting it moved anywhere else. 

Beware that stock is likely to get worse not better though. So if you can currently see something you like the look of, jump for it now and get a deposit on it. Some of the cars you see listed there are assigned to the dealer but haven't arrived yet. So it could be 2-3 weeks before it's all ready to drive away.

As has been said above, there's plenty of charging options. Check out ABRP to plan your route and charging, and Zap Map for reassurance of just how many charge points there are, and see comments from others to ensure they are reliably working. The MINI Has a small battery yes but it charges nice and fast. It shouldn't be a problem and gives you good practice with your new car. Just keep the car in Eco mode, try not to go too far above 60mph and keep the heater set to a comfortable, warm temperature rather than hot. You should get a decent range between charges there.

So there is some advice - make sure that the dealer realises that they should have the car at 100% when you pick it up. An extra 50% is worth at least 60 miles extra before you need to find your first charge stop.

I've made several charge points now and posted the circuit diagram of the oldest one (made back in 2013) here a few days ago. Nothing very challenging, really, it's just a contactor to switch the power on and off controlled by a very simple circuit. Open PEN fault protection is provided by wiring it as a TT installation, cheap and easy (probably no more than ¬£30 extra). DC tolerant earth leakage protection is via a Type B RCD, with over current protection via an MCB. 

The second charge point I installed here was made using off-the-shelf parts, a Viridian EPC, a 32 A DP contactor, and a DIN rail mount timer so that it can either charge during the off-peak period, or charge immediately. That's also protected via a Type B RCD, and MCB and by wiring it as a TT installation for open PEN fault protection.

All pretty simple stuff, there's nothing at all complex about the way an EVSE works, really. What makes some of the commercially available units massively more complex than they need to be is the government insistence that all grant funded charge point must be smart and internet connected. That complicates the electronics in the things my a couple of orders of magnitude at least, and makes them reliant on sometimes flaky software and connectivity. My view is that a charge point needs to be as reliable and simple to use as a light switch.",2,3141635.0

My story is quite similar, but mine only survived 25 miles after delivery before it died. In a car park on the first day I owned it, it refused to start 'Drivetrain fault' - funny that it said 'do not turn off engine', when it was already off.
I called Mini assistance and they sent a technician (although as a the car had only been registered 3 days before, the registration number didn't exist in any of their systems so I had to persuade them that yes, it is a real car...). Long story short, after multiple calls to BMW/Mini UK nobody had any idea what the problem was - 35 messages on the diagnostic computer, many of which nobody really understood. First Mini PHEV the technician had ever seen, and no record of this failure with any Countryman in the UK to date. A few hard resets (disconnect the 12v battery, wait 5 minutes, reconnect) they admitted defeat and it was recovered to Sytner Leicester. (we had to push it to a place the recovery truck could get at it - very HEAVY). And that was the last I saw of it for 4 weeks.

Mini gave me a previous shape Mini Countryman Cooper SD for 3 weeks, and then I complained a lot to Sytners and they got me a brand new a 5 series from BMW UK until it was back. My understanding is that one of the cells in the drive batteries had failed and took out one of the ECU computers that controls the drivetrain, so although the petrol engine was fine it refused to start because the battery had a error. Mini UK technicians had to come and work on it, change the battery cells, many cables, ECU's, etc. I have a feeling they never really understood the problem, just threw parts at it until it was fixed.

I did think long and hard about cancelling and reordering a new one, but I didn't want to wait another 4 months for the spec I wanted. In the end I got a free Type 2 cable from the selling dealership, and a lot of apologies.

That was in November, and now 8,000 miles later the car is perfect, no issues so I am glad I stuck with it. But I really think that as PHEV's start to get old and batteries and control systems fail, they are going to be bet avoided on the second hand market.",1,0.0

-24 hours later it failed again and now my local dealer hasn't a clue.

The car would not start and gave a whole bunch of errors that made no sense. We tried starting it multiple times, but it would just keep on doing the same errors.

We finally used the Mini Road Assitance to call for a tow to our local dealer. When the tow truck arrived, lo and behold, it decided to start up! With only the gasoline engine running.
We took the car to the dealer ourselves with the tow truck driving behind just in case. It had the engine light on throughout the trip.

If the car is in gear. Even if not moving the pedestrian warning noise is active. Fairly quiet in D, and louder in reverse. Obviously it gets louder and matches your speed as you accelerate up to about 20mph.

If the car wasn't in gear then it was likely the air conditioning compressor. If it was that, you can simply turn off the AC altogether and it should stop. 

Other than that there are little electrical devices, pumps and the like which will be running for example ones that make the brakes function correctly. On my MINI some of these can even be felt from inside the car sitting in the drivers seat with the car switched on but stationary in P. Every now and then you'll feel the entire car move ever so slightly as different systems click on and off.

Was just about to post this!

I had the off peak period set to the Octopus Go 0030 - 0430 times and set a departure time for 0700 as without setting a time you can't actually set the off peak period. (Which seems a bit daft.) However, I changed the departure time to 0500 (not that I'm planning on it) and now it seems to start charging at 0030 quite happily. I had to leave this morning at about 0650 and it started charging at 0030 and was fully charged (according to the notifications as I was asleep!) at about 0400.

I'm not entirely sure why changing the departure time from 0700 to 0500 has done this but, all the same, it's fine!  

Thanks for your help.

The GTE has greater EV range and more control is available for the driver.
With a very limited EV range it makes sense to retain it for driving rather than interior heating which is more efficiently provided from the waste heat from the ICE. Also, the Mini has its 4WD trick which is only available with EV power so reserving the battery range for that makes sense in ""extreme"" cold.

I had a BMW 225xe the countryman is basically the same car in drag.

The answer to your question is that if you drive it in comfort mode they feel a bit asthmatic when the battery is traction battery is low compared to having > 10% charge.

This is helped greatly by flicking to sport mode but they aren‚Äôt especially efficient once the battery is low.

Expect circa 40mpg of you drive it carefully when the HV battery is flat.

You won‚Äôt get 15 miles out of the first gen countryman with the circa 7kW battery in winter even with the heater off.

You will probably just about do it in summer though.

I didn‚Äôt own mine for long enough to comment on how badly the battery degrades as it ages but I haven‚Äôt heard great reports about them.

The second gen cars have battery capacity of around 11kW As memory serves, I can‚Äôt comment on this one but I believe they advertise that these can do over 30 miles fully charged, whatever BMW quote knock 20% off that and that is closer to real world reality.

They also aren‚Äôt especially reliable as they age and if something goes wrong expect a very large bill from BMW to fix it.

As long as it‚Äôs under warranty, all is well.

With the 11kW battery it will easily do a daily 15 miles so you should do most of your miles without the ICE.

The electric bits of mine were much more reliable than the ICE, for the cost of a new PHEV countryman you do have quite a few fully electric options though nowadays that will easily do 150 miles.

Hi

I had considered a full electric but then when I looked at the locations in the UK where we normally tour when on holiday the lack of charging points is almost nonexistent.

I have looked at ZAP map when I was researching the possibility of a full electric, and one thing that did surprise me was the number of charging points which had been reported as out of action.

This is something I had observed when out and about before the COVID restrictions.

So a PHEV looked to be a possibility until such time as the charging network dramatically improves.

Range will improve a little in the summer with dry roads, less wind, and no need for the heating. Likewise as we go into winter your range will get worse with wind and rain/ice, cold temperatures and the use of the heater. 

Obviously make full use of regenerative braking and plan ahead to help maximise your range. Take it easy by accelerating gently and dropping your speed a little on the motorway.

Well I certainly rattled someones cage. Just to put the record straight the Mini is my wife's car, although I love driving it when I can (shopping runs). She's a NHS nurse and local volunteer, helping those that have been shielding. I'm proud to say she's been doing her bit. She is also primary carer for her mother (84) who has dementia and her step father (87) who has mobility issues. They live 30 miles away and are in need of regular visits and haven't left their house since March. 100% of the 600 miles has been for essential use. The Volvo was bought primarily as my vehicle (I mainly work from home) and to pull our caravan. It was bought prior to Covid and I looked into EV's but couldn't find one in my price range that could pull my caravan. I consciously went for a petrol instead of a diesel despite the lower torque and mpg, as it was environmentally the correct thing to do. Being sensible, we haven't towed the caravan since getting the Volvo. Overall I think we are doing our fair share for both the environment and pandemic.",5,2948985.0

Now, its not a great booster seat, lacks some of the safety features you may need for younger/smaller children, but as luck would have it, it fits our child perfectly.

If you only need a car to do 35 miles a day, then just about any BEV from any era will manage that.

PHEVs will cut your petrol usage by about a third on any long journey. I've posted before that my GTE will do at least 30-50 electric miles for every 100-150 driven. 50 electric miles a day doesn't sound so bad does it, and still better than 100% petrol or diesel. 

I couldn't do 100-150 miles in my old i3 without stopping to recharge or using the REX. 50-75 miles each way isn't an unusual commute for a lot of people these days, and 150 a day is nothing for 'Gareth Cheeseman, photocopier salesman'.

Whilst I wouldn't ever describe myself as an 'eco warrior', there's no doubt that I was prepared to pay (using my own money) for a car that didn't just have a greener 'image' but one that is genuinely more economical than an equivalent size and power petrol car. 

I struggled to hit 50mpg in my similarly sized and powered BMW 120d unless I drove like a saint. 

I would not have purchased a GTD-E, should one have existed, not only because of the diesel emissions issue but also that such a beast would be even heavier than the GTE, given the weight of the diesel lump. 

We all make choices as to what we drive for all sorts of reasons, and let's not forget that every vehicle has a pollution and resources penalty, even BEVs.

I'm assuming that average commute distance is round trip? In which case if the user had charging at both end (ooh er!) then this PHEV could be an excellent solution.

I agree more battery range would be desirable, but 20 miles is better than nothing and 20 less ICE miles.

It's even better than that though, go 75 miles and you'll likely get 25-30 electric miles, drive 100 miles and you'll probably get 35-40 electric miles. 

The EV only range is just one part of the car, used as a hybrid (which it is) it makes even more sense. 

What doesn't make any sense is buying one as a 100% electric car, there are better options for that even if you're only driving 20 miles a day. What's the point in dragging an engine around just for the odd trip?

I applaud you for doing that and reducing local emissions. 

The point I was making was that for a lot of private owners the total 3 year cost of running a GTE will be more than a GTD. A few drivers who mainly drive in EV mode may save a few quid. Others may be happy to keep car longer to save money, but people who buy new cars generally don't do that.

I believe most sales of new PHEVs are to company car drivers. Be interesting to see stats. When I bought my first (expensive) Ampera it would have cost more as a private car over 3 years than the Lexus I also looked at. To reduce costs I purchased it (and replacement) through my company. 

A friend of mine is a perfect candidate for a PHEV as he could commute to work on EV and does very little other driving. Instead he gets the bus (exercise walking) and has just bought a new diesel Tiguan. I guess that is ""greener""?",0,372829.0

March 2017 is the estimate for the rest of the range, the SE is expected in the summer (closer to June/July).

Just from my perspective, I'm intrigued by the SE, primarily because it looks like it might actually be the car I wanted my current (Auris hybrid) to be. Specifically, it should have the electric capacity to lower my (not inconsiderable) fuel bills, and the tech side of the Minis is good for integration, and for some of the gamification features.

I'd agree for the OTR price, but I've seen the pricing go a bit ... wonky with Minis and leases/PCPs. GF had one that knocked about ¬£50/month off the ¬£170/month when she added on a tech pack.

The Mini residual value numbers seem to be more than slightly out of the ordinary for cars in their class.

I can't comment if the mini is better than the GTE but it certainly didn't feel sluggish - the power delivery is obviously smoother than my diesel and the petrol engine doesn't sound tinny when pushed - I tested over a variety of dual carriageways and small country roads and it seemed as agile as my GTD.

Worse of all it annoyingly hasn't been shaped to fit in the boots underfloor storage. IMO some one somewhere in industrial design wants shooting for that.

I drove one today after having borrowed an i3 on loan for two nights, I didn't realise that it even existed until I saw it hogging the charging spot that I'd originally driven the i3 away from.
My sister has the diesel version, the hybrid was noticeably quicker and a hell of a lot more refined.
It handles better than I expected, quite sharp and chuckable for a biggish car, much better than my leaf but not as good as the Golf GTE (which is currently my plug-in hybrid gold standard).

Key advantage over the golf would be the boot which I was told was the same as the standard model, unlike the golf which looses a fair chunk of a smaller to begin with boot compared to its siblings due to the fuel tank having to be moved there. I was told that in the mini the batteries are under the rear bench raising them slightly (although I couldnt tell the difference between it and my sisters car).

in e 'green' mode its nice enough, but the engine kicks in at the slightest provocation. Floor it and the engine comes in with a fair whack after what feels like (but might not be) a second and a bit or so, for more reasonable levels of acceleration it comes in quite nicely. I expect that it feels quite pleasing to someone coming from a 'normal' car and I'll admit that it was quite fun and has more poke than the leaf, but on the other hand the power isn't delivered instantly like I'm used to in as predictable or controllable a manner as I'm used to from the leaf.

The best way to describe it as if a big chain is pulled if you can imagine the tug as soon as the chain becomes taught.

Of the hybrids I've driven, for power and refinement of the drivetrain, the i3 Rex is in a different league to anything else (although I'm not going to buy one for a long list of other reasons). Of the rest the Golf GTE is head and shoulders the best in terms of power delivery.
The mini stands at its shoulder
The Volvo diesel plug-in (cant remember the model number but it was an estate like heavy tank) some where near the belly, when the two power sources eventually worked it unison it was actually quite brutal and very noisy. 
Hyundai Ioniq somewhere round the knees (although I only drove the mild hybrid not the plug-in) its power delivery was awful in terms of lag and then a thump gear changes whilst cornering were particularly unsettling. 

because the mini's engine comes in so readily (even in 'green' mode) I'd take 20 EV pure miles with a pinch of salt, I reckon most people will use at least a few drops of petrol every day.

I liked it a lot though, possibly more than I expected but not enough for it to join my current shortlist of potential leaf replacements. - Not least because I'm told that due to demand the earliest delivery slots are now in November,

Overall I'm quite sure it will sell really well and become an EV gateway drug to a large number of existing diesel drivers. If they ramp up production to meet demand, I wont be surprised if it eventually ends up outselling the Outlander",3,0.0

In which case a PHEV makes no financial sense unless it is a company car with lower BIK. The fuel saving on 50 EV miles a week just don't pay the extra cost of a PHEV compared to diesel model and you get lower MPG on long journeys.

My first Ampera made no financial sense, despite a 40+ mile commute, which is why I bought it through my company to get 100% WDA and at that time (2012) very low BIK.

I maintain that low range PHEVs are unlikely to be popular as used cars. Lots of reasons - servicing is no cheaper (some more expensive) than an ICE, perception (*) that batteries will need replacing, more to go wrong, automatic only (so not ideal for learner in family), MPG not good on long journeys, etc. Only attraction IMO is for people who want good performance (on open road) combined with low emissions around town.

For me its not so much the absolute range thats the issue, 15 miles would actually do the job for my commute, its more that even well within that range you will use fuel every time you slip out of miss daisy mode and the engine has to step in to provide a bit more oomph.

I suspect this is more less of an issue for people coming from an ICE background who rarely used all of the power and torque. They will primarily only notice a drop in frequency of petrol stations visits.

What is the power delivery and gearbox like? Even on ICE the Outlander drives like an EV, it has effectively a CVT gearbox so is always very smooth to drive. I saw the Countryman has a 6 speed auto, do you notice the gear changes? 

Hoping for a test drive this week or next week when my local dealer can get hold of one.

Also, anyone seen any 'cheap' lease deals on the Countryman PHEV? I'm being quoted around ¬£450pm and looking to get at least below ¬£400.

There is a little bit of lag on acceleration from a standing start, particularly hard acceleration before the engine kicks in (with a bit of a thump) and I did notice the gear changes, but only on hard acceleration (I'm moving from an Outlander PHEV that is effectively CVT).

The demonstrator had all the toys (Chili, Tech etc.) although it took me 3 journeys until I noticed the HUD. Clearly not something I would miss if I downgraded to the Media pack.

The sports seats are just the right size for me, and with the storage pack I love the little cubby hole you get in the drivers seat. The boot does lose some space below the lip level due to the battery, but is still a reasonable size for a mid SUV.

With a 118 mile each way commute you want to set the sat nav every time, put it in Green mode and let the car sort out when to use Battery or fuel. It will be more efficient overall than getting '20 miles on electric' if that is what you meant.

In green and with sat nav on it plans ahead for uphill, downhill, type of roads and will maximize mpg on the motorway by using the battery to run the fan, radio, lights etc while the engine is under load.

Firstly I must apologize for my terrible maths earlier, I had a bit of a Diane Abbott moment.

The short answer to this is yes. It makes the battery charge much quicker, even much quicker than it would be charged when plugged in to a full power wall charger.

But as mentioned it kills your mpg driving like that. The only reason for it would be if you were driving towards an emission free zone or just don't like 'polluting' in town or something.

I am convinced the best way is to use Green, auto. Use the sat nav (even if it is for a 10 mile daily drive), drive like a Granny and let the software sort the rest.

Hi Dazdrum - thanks for the reply and the tips. I originally went for the GTE as it came loaded with kit, I enjoyed the test drive and it has had some good reviews.

The MINI seems to have the edge on its performance and handling over the GTE and as I have a 15 mile each way commute the electric range should be good enough for me and I will be able to charge at both ends of journey.

Anyway, I will find out for myself tomorrow! 

Good to hear you are enjoying yours and I will let you know how I get on.

I had a MINI Countryman JCW before and the PHEV seems to drive much better on the motorway with much less road noise. Very smooth switching from electric to petrol. The new screen is far superior to the previous model and I‚Äôm delighted with Apple CarPlay with the split screen showing a choice of album art/sat nav or car info etc. Still learning how to use it all, but initial thoughts are excellent!

I‚Äôve not checked out preconditioning yet but will attempt to in the next few days. 

My Mini dealer was fantastic too...I didn‚Äôt order from my local Mini dealer who I have purchased from previously, as they only offered a very small discount.

Name: Unnamed: 0, dtype: int64",47921,"Dec 10, 2017","Hi all I've been watching this thread for a while but thought I'd contribute as I picked mine up last week

Ordered on 6th Sep, picked up on 3rd Dec, so about 12 weeks which wasn't bad, it actually came in slightly earlier than initially suggested.

I went for the tech pack which includes the CarPlay, although I think the media pack includes this as well.

I've been using the preconditioning quite a lot, although I notice the battery drops to about 93%. Reading on the i3 forums (and in the manual) this is because the 3pin plug charges slightly slower than the battery drain from the preconditioning. I'd also considered the suggestion of setting the start time 30 mins prior, I was late this morning getting in the car, and it had charged back up to about 97%. I'm going to order the pod point home charger (3.7kwh) which has a 60% improvement on charging, so preconditioning should still give you 100% battery.

Other observations: I was hoping the app would allow some remote control of preconditioning but appears not. Also, electric range isn't brilliant, I'm getting about 14-16 miles at the moment but hoping it's the cold weather. Having said that, had a 40 mile round trip to Reading and back yesterday, this is where it came into its own, really smooth ride, really efficient and clean leaving home and coming into Reading (especially as traffic was terrible) then used the ICE on the dual carriageway and used battery save to get a bit of charge back for local driving.

I've left the mpg counter as is, and am still averaging 99.9mpg as am doing quite a few local journeys and the occasional longer journey.

I seriously considered the GTE, but the long wait time, plus the fact I liked the mini styling and wanted to move away from hothatch to an SUV (two previous cars were golf gti and Audi s3) meant this seemed like a really good fit. Plus, I'm not a company car driver, I've purchased this myself as I like the technology and hate diesel cars, but wanted something with good fuel economy and still some decent power

Anyway those of you that have ordered/received then enjoy your pre-christmas presents, those of you that are considering then I'd thoroughly recommend so far.",3,0.0

Hi Bleachey, great choice of car, do you know if the car can show combined MPG of battery and petrol as it appears to be only showing one or the other plus there is some info on Kw used which I haven't yet grasped. 

With pre-conditioning set I only get about 16 miles as well when plugged into the 240v socket.

Thanks for your reply, Bleachey. 

I had the test drive yesterday morning and was suitably impressed. I drove the car in all the modes and in the half hour or so I drove the car the battery went from 83% to 77% - it was about 2 degrees C.

Of course, you can feel a bit of extra weight but I think MINI have done a good job of disguising it. 

The only downside for me was the dealer trying to push a PCP deal and this was coming out about ¬£70 a month more than an online quote on a PCH deal, which is what I am after.

The MINI and the GTE are different beasts, but I think it is a close call on driveability, you pays yer money, you takes yer choice, I suppose. 

My VW dealer will be asking for an update on my GTE build date (currently 23rd April, potentially delivered late May or early June - car needed 6th March!); they have confirmed my deposit will be refunded without fuss if I cancel. 

Consensus seems to be that the MINI delivery times are much shorter although the dealer said if I ordered now it would be a few weeks before they could confirm delivery date and it could be early, on time or a couple of weeks after my required date - I think that is everything covered, then! But at least it shouldn‚Äôt stretch to May or June.

Also, when I test drove the MINI last Saturday the dealer told me new builds would have the touch screens. I agree the Tech and Chili packs cover just about all the desirable goodies (not sure why folding mirrors could not be part of the package?).

The car I drove just had the Chili pack and HUD was added (I liked that) and the bigger non-touch Nav - it seemed a shame not to have the Harmon Kardon upgrade on this particular car - might be be re-configuring with the Chili & Tech packs and then comparing (Redholt) costs versus the bits you have picked out!

It's one of those things isn't it, as Dieselheads would highlight that you could probably get more, but not that much more... and you'd have to have a diesel!

Hi Redholt,
I can't comment specifically on which pack includes the touch screen, but I would thoroughly recommend the upgraded screen if your budget can support it.

My recommendation is not to bother with the heated front screen as these are very expensive to replace, and can create a mesh that can be irritating. As you've highlighted the preconditioning function will clear the screen in the morning anyway, I've tested this myself on Saturday and worked really well.

I definitely went for the heated front seats, heated, dimming and foldable mirrors. I would definitely recommend the front parking sensors, and I ended up going for the drivers assistance pack as it includes adaptive cruise control which is awesome, but also includes the rear view camera.

A word of warning if you weren't aware of this already, the ¬£40k VED tax threshold represents the list price before any discounts...INCLUDING the government olev grant. As a result, although I got a very good discount through carwow, I had to forego the sunroof and automatic tailgate",1,0.0

Hi Redholt, do you really need the rear arm rest as the middle section of the rear seat back does fold done and would give you a low arm rest. Defo go for the bigger screen especially as you can have it with split screen. My car has the Chili and Media packs which has everything I want, the Harmon Kardon speakers would have been nice but what comes with the car is good enough especially as the bass speakers are in the floor so you get no rattling doors.

Good luck with your choice, you will love the car. Sport mode and auto box in sport mode is amazing and addictive when it puts the car into eboost, so many of my petrol head mates are shocked on how quick the car is and would now consider getting one. When the auto box is in sport mode you can really notice the regen breaking which you can't in green mode- yes I do drive the car in green mode most of the time to get the best MPG.",1,1587065.0

Well, I had a (not so little) bundle of joy delivered to me at lunchtime today. 

First impressions:
* so much easier to get in and out of than my Merc C Class that‚Äôs just gone back - my back will thank me for that one
* suspension not as hard as I remember, felt good over varied ground on the short runs I‚Äôve done this arvo
* near silent running is a real pleasure and makes for a more peaceful drive around town
* I‚Äôve covered around 15 miles and only noticed the engine coming on a few times 
* good visibility out of the cockpit and reduced blind spots compared to the Merc. 
* the Connected app doesn‚Äôt seem to add much value and destinations don‚Äôt seem to travel well between the phone and the car meaning I‚Äôm reprogramming the sat nag when I get in. 
* I can see i‚Äôll need a wall charging box soon as I don‚Äôt think I‚Äôll be too bothered to keep opening the garage and plugging the granny charger in all the time.

You have to hold the lock button down for a couple of seconds to power the mirrors away which is a little annoying but they do make life easier in car parks and for squeezing by on a tight driveway. 

The Chili pack was a must have for me, with the comfort access and the heated seats (especially as I guess the heater sucks the battery performance). 

Power boot has come in handy already twice on the first day so I‚Äôm pleased I specced that. I suspect it‚Äôll also be good when I get up to Big Yellow Storage later today to empty my container.

Hi Neil, I think there‚Äôs a lack of info on this as there‚Äôs no precise answer. 

Hybrid performance totally depends on the weather, the type of roads, your speed, traffic and elevation changes. Sounds like a dodge but each journey will be different so no specific answer to be given. 

In my experience, I‚Äôve had from 37 - 60 MPG when running on ‚Äòempty battery‚Äô as it hasn‚Äôt fallen below 7 or 8% yet and the regen in the overrun helps top up where it can. 

One thing I can tell you is that if most of your journey is motorway and you keep pace with the regular traffic then expect to see the lower end of my scale. If it‚Äôs A / B roads with relatively slower driving and more variation in lifting off then the MPG will be higher.

I did a 70 odd mile trip to the south coast on Christmas Eve using single carriageway roads. Started with maybe 50% battery and got 73MPG for the trip. Averaged 39 on way home as used M3, A34 and M4 with typical motorway speeds and MPG suffered at 40 for the privilege",0,1629857.0

No worries, that‚Äôs my rationale too (plus the savings in BiK over my previous Merc C250). That car recently struggled to give me 50MPG+ on a decent run thanks to the cold and town driving was giving me c.20 so I‚Äôm glad to be shot of that. 

Haven‚Äôt seen anything in the 20‚Äôs at all yet and I‚Äôve been running it in sport and the sport setting on the gearbox for some fun at the lights too. 

It has the same published 0-60 time as my previous Merc but the launch off the lights seems much sharper - it‚Äôll be losing out around 40-45 upwards I guess when the punch of the previous 500 NM would be more useful. 

Like I say, pick your roads carefully and you don‚Äôt have to be losing out too much on the longer journeys.

Hi Neil, I have a daily work commute of 136 miles and the car is doing a lot of that with the engine - auto edrive in green mode and I get 55mpg, thats on B and A roads so my speed is anything from 30 ish to 70 ish. 
I always use the satnav as this then seems to determine when the petrol or electric engine runs the car.

As jonobigblind has said this is a great car from the traffic lights, everything in sport and the traction control off - you will be surprised. Timed by my son 0-60 , 6.2 secs, over taking is a dream in this car!

I went for this car also because the BiK tax is so low , which meant I got a good spec car ( chili+media ) and the performance I wanted, win win all the way.",2,1629857.0

Hi First Draft,

ermmmmmm why go for the bigger screen, thats a difficult one , would I miss it ? yes I would now , but if I hadn't had it, no! It is good in the way it can be split screen for satnav and radio/music etc. I have an iPhone so apple car play gets used all the time as well as the wireless charger (part of the media pack) in the arm rest.

I would defo get the Chili pack and then think of what is important to you both. I personally think the standard car with Chili pack would be enough for most

JCW Chili / Tech
Island Blue metallic with black roof and mirror caps
Folding mirrors 
Sun protection glass

Yes, so far I have not heard of any long delivery times on the MINI; 12 weeks seems to be about the norm - slightly shorter than the 36 weeks on the Golf!

On the GTE forum, by far the most talked about subject is the factory lead times. The lead times jump around all over the place but over time get longer and longer - VW have royally cocked up on this model and it is annoying to say the least that they have not come forward and explained what has gone wrong and what they are going to do to address the problem (other than saying they have stopped taking GTE orders).

Before I initially ordered the Golf GTE (now cancelled) I left a couple of messages with a dealer asking for a MINI PHEV test drive - they didn‚Äôt have the courtesy to call me back, let alone arrange a test drive.

That is why I went for the Golf in the first place, and it is only because VW were incapable of giving a static build date that I switched back to the MINI!

At least this time, Coopers Thames Ditton were very quick to arrange a test drive but as they were not competitive on pricing up a PCH, I went through Tilsun Group to order the car.

Welcome Doggo, hope the waiting isn‚Äôt getting too much for you!

You‚Äôll certainly notice the difference in performances off the lights. I don‚Äôt race but I still haven‚Äôt been beaten in the traffic light Grand Prix yet . The BiK savings are a bonus too as I‚Äôve noticed in my pay packet last month. 

In terms of energy provider, Bulb seem popular and have a ¬£50 credit when you switch and refer. Use that right and you can have some months of free motoring!

You don‚Äôt need a wall box as you can charge from a 3 pin socket with the cable provided but it does speed the process up and also is less hassle than using a 3 pin charger. Charged EV tend to have some good deals every so often and you don‚Äôt want to end up spending too much on one (as this will just eat into the savings). There are a few hoops to jump through (off road parking, distance from consumer unit etc. But you can check these out with the installer on their website to ensure you qualify). Costs somewhere around 70-80p to fully charge so not going to break the bank and better if you can charge at your destination without any cost to you. 

I‚Äôve signed up with Polar for their free three month trial and have been enjoying a few charges at my local Waitrose as there are 4 spaces there and I‚Äôve only ever seen one other EV parked up. You‚Äôll need a public charging cable though but these can be bought from eBay for around ¬£90 second hand or the dealer for ¬£160 new. 

The Minis still don‚Äôt seem to be very popular on the roads, I‚Äôve only seen two others around Swindon and none elsewhere on my travels.",2,0.0

Welcome, Doggo2805 - enjoy the motor when it arrives. I am only slightly jealous as mine is due in March, just waiting to hear confirmation on the date! I am stepping out of a BMW 118d Sport, so a very similar situation to yours except I am giving up my company car for cash in lieu and looking forward to lots of cheap motoring as I will be able to charge up at home and at work, for free.

As far as home chargers are concerned, there are quite a few options and opinions out there.

I went for a Pod Point (obviously not yet used), but when I did my research I preferred the look of it to some others (unless you pay silly money for an Andersen or such like) and its 3 year on-site warranty. By all accounts they seem reliable; there are quite a few negative things said about Rolec but also some good things, so if you go for a home charger, you just need to weigh up the pros and cons versus costs, I guess. And it seems prices on some units are coming down.

I went for a tethered unit as I didn‚Äôt want the hassle in the dark or wet faffing with a cable in and out the boot each time; also, as Jonobigblind said, the home charging option is faster and less hassle than the 3 pin option.

As I am impatient, I have also bought a public charging cable ahead of my car arriving! I could have bought a secondhand one but decided to buy new and got one from BMW Sytner Coventry via eBay for ¬£150, including delivery and a 2 year warranty. This is the MINI cable i.e the lurid green / yellow version! Standard price elsewhere is ¬£165 so far as I could see. Any type 2 cable will work, but some companies charge more than for an official MINI / BMW one (BMW cables are blue).

When you get the car, lots of pics please, and let us know how you get on with it!

Also, just curious, when did you order your car?

Cheers,

On some recent long motorway journeys, I have been PHEV spotting (yes, I know, I am sad, but you have your MINI, so humour me) - the Outlander is by far the most popular, followed by Tesla then Golf GTE (only saw three of these, lost count on the other two). The Mercedes and BMW PHEVS are a bit harder to spot at a glance as well.

No MINI PHEVs spotted yet on the motorways, but I have seen a grey one on my regular commute down the A40 near Harrow a couple of times and a black one near Heathrow.

I read that there were only a 1000 Countryman‚Äôs allocated for the UK in 2017, so no wonder there are not many out and about just yet.

Apologies, for the delay in replying - busy few days! I'm enjoying the new whip and seems to perform well wherever take it. Assured footing on the M4 and A419 and also easy enough to negotiate around towns and multi-story sardine tins.

I have noticed a big decrease in the 'eDrive' range in the cold weather when the battery is 100% sometimes only 14 miles with the heater (16 without) but then it does seem to go a bit further if driven carefully. I live just outside of London so not even that cold.

When it is really cold the engine comes on just after you push the start toggle. If you are quick you can sometimes beat it to eDrive but it must be for a reason so I wouldn't do that if it is. After a minute or two I can always select eDrive.

I have only driven once in the snow, which was really just slush once and found the way to get moving is to select sport mode, dynamic traction on, then put the gear stick into 'manual mode'. This completely stops the engine from switching off, you can then move away and the traction control will allow a bit of slip but will engage the rear wheels almost immediately, but you don't see the yellow boost light. As you are not 'boosting'. You will see the diagram in the center screen show power to the rear wheels if you have that one showing.

This is also by far the best way I have found to get a quick start. Set the center console lights to be the rev counter (which took me 4 months to realize was an option ) and it becomes pretty fun! Especially when it is slippy!!",2,0.0

Some people are buying plug in hybrids as a company car as BIK is low versus a similar sized diesel or petrol car and then don‚Äôt care if they never plug in.

Hi Jamo and welcome. 

My trip to the office is 56 miles each way (when I can be bothered to go in) and is mainly M4/A34 with a bit of local so a fairly similar profile to yours. If I leave fully charged I can get about 45 MPG for the journey and about 40 if not.

The economy really takes a dive at motorway speeds so if you could find a more pleasurable way to do the commute then it's worth a look. If I take the scenic route through Wiltshire and into Hampshire then I have seen 60MPG but there's a trade off with the time etc...

I came from a Merc C250d and the BiK savings are noticeable so I can swallow a bit of a hit in consumption for longer journeys. I do miss the mid-range grunt from my old 500NM engine though, that was a good unit when up to speed. 

I'm probably getting about 10 miles on a full charge in this cold weather at the moment when plodding around town.

Hi Jono, 

Thanks for the response - very helpful! That's not too bad to be honest. I'd expected to take a hit on my current economy and I'd accepted that - I really don't want another diesel! The BIK savings for me at the moment are minimal to be honest, due to the list price of the PHEV vs my current cooper D. 

I'm completely new to the idea of EVs, so excuse the question, but do you generally have to pay to use EV charging points in public? My job involves visiting remote sites occasionally where the only option might be a public charging point if I can't make public transport work.

No need to apologise for the questions (at least not on this thread, we're a friendly enough bunch in here). You'll build up a good picture of what works for you by combining a few different sources of info. SpeakEV is a good start to get the low down on the etiquette of charging (as there are different chargers for different needs).

ZapMap is a good resource (phone app or online) to show you where chargers are and if they cost. Some also update in real time to show if they're in use.

Unfortunately it seems that there are more charging companies than there really need to be and some of their charging structures and subscription models differ so there isn't one size fits all approach.

I don't go out of my way to charge when out and about as it doesn't put too much charge into the battery for the time I'm there but I use Polar network (free three month subscription) at my local Waitrose so I can get there and back on battery. Pod Point have a free charger at a small retail park the other side of town so I'll tend to use that if I'm around there.

Motorway charging and other 'rapid' chargers should really be out of the equation for PHEV drivers as they work out too expensive for the charge gained, plus most of us can't take a rapid charge and just end up hogging the space when a BEV driver could make more use of it.

Have a look on ZapMap or PlugShare and you can filter for Type 2 chargers (which Minis use when out and about) 3.3 or 7kw chargers are the sweet spot for our cars so you can get a view how useful their locations are for you on your regular routes.

You can always charge off your 3 pin charging point if you've got a friendly client who'll let you plug in and take a charge from them. It's about 70-90p for a full charge on your home account depending on unit price obvs.

**Edit** Just remembered, you'll have to pick up a type 2 public charging cable as they don't come with them (only a home 3 pin one). Budget ¬£90-¬£160 depending if you go second hand or brand new.",0,1808025.0

Hi Dazdrum, I took delivery of my MINI PHEV a week last Thursday, it was 10 weeks late, the problem was when it arrived into the UK, it wouldn't start and it took all this time before they rectified the problems and still don't know what they were as all the parts had to be specially ordered from Germany.

On Monday they tell me that the parts they need are on back order and could take up to 10 days to get!
On Tuesday I call them and say that Mini Assist had said I should be in a hire car of a Mini not an Astra- which after having the Mini, the Astra is bloody horrible and uncomfortable ( sorry to any one who has the new shape Astra , but its not my cup of tea ), so the dealer says leave it with us and we will sort it out. They now miraculously have the parts- thats funny I thought they were on back order! have they stripped them out of another car?
Today the dealer phones me to say that my car is all sorted and I can collect it tomorrow lunch time  but they are being very secretive in what the problem was.

A module box that the orange HV cables, the electric motor and the regen braking go into/through failed and had to be renewed.

I thought it would be alot better. Driving short journeys around town etc it was between 55 -70mpg which i expected to be high as the electric motor did most of the miles.

Anyway, the Mini was only a week old and only had 500 miles on it. The sales guy didn't have a clue about the car and I ask if the battery was fully charged and he said yes. But when I got home and went through the controls before my journey it only had 7% charge so the car was using mostly the petrol engine and I got 37mpg on my first part of my journey. The car itself is fun to drive and is a decent size but I think my leaf had more space and definitely has a bigger boot than the mini. Overall, I liked the car but the mpg and the space was a bit of a let-down for me. It still but a smile on my face when driving it.

Hi Chris,

I get my MINI next Tuesday so can‚Äôt comment on the supplied cable but I bought a public charging cable in advance, which is the yellow / green colour, rather than the BMW i version, which has a blue cable, but otherwise, they are identical - that is a bit disappointing that yours didn‚Äôt come supplied, as surely, that is the whole point?

Has the heated seat been fixed or are you waiting for that to be done? 

I realise it is a company car, but that shouldn‚Äôt stop you from having a moan at both of these issues!

Mate you shouldn't use that slow cable anyway, get a 16 amp cable and tethered is best, with 20 mile range you will be recharging a LOT so you need to make the process as easy as possible.

To be honest the 20mile range means the electric is a gimmick for people commuting more than 30miles each way, but if you are based at home or an office where you are in and out several times a day then you can function on almost all electric. Get a 16amp cable wall box to speed charging to 2 hours 10 mins or so, tethered to make it easier to charge (less plugging in of cables, one end is always in!) and you may need to charge 2 or 3 times a day but you can run on pure electric. But my wife commutes 50 miles each way each day with no charging point at the work end, so of a 100mile journey she only gets 15 or so on electric (heating on full power in morning so range contracts!).

The black makes the Island Blue look darker (or possibly it's the photo), as on the website the viedo car with the white roof and stripes in Island Blue looks a lighter, more sky blue shade. Either is good.

I have only seen the previous gen in BRG, and I quite liked it; SWMBO didn‚Äôt, so that was the end of that.

My previous two cars have been grey and silver, hence I went for the blue. My head-on picture is much more representative of the true shade of blue - I have seen two Island Blues at dealers and the white roof does seem to lighten the body-blue a touch, to my eyes.

On the MINI hatchback there is a very fetching blue, I don‚Äôt know the colour‚Äôs name, and that is a shade lighter than the Island Blue.

I‚Äôve been trying to find an answer to the 4 wheel drive with an empty battery issue and found this:

Driven in this mode, the Countryman delivers that classic EV trait of instant and formidable torque. The performance does bleed off after the initial surge, but it‚Äôs enough to make good progress without troubling the combustion engine. (Incidentally, the battery always holds some capacity in reserve. This means that the car retains its four-wheel-drive capability and the full performance potential even when the electric-only range is exhausted.)

Taken from The Engineer drives: plug-in hybrid Mini speeds ahead

I have had my mini for a few weeks now and I absolutely love it and am still finding out little things about it. I have named her The Beast as she really is one!

Spec of my beast:
Red with black roof
Pretty much every option chosen barring sunroof, electric seats (slightly regret that one), picnic bench, and one or two others that I can‚Äôt remember. My salesman said he had never specc‚Äôed a mini so expensive! It went over ¬£40k so I have the extra tax to pay for the next 5 years but I thought it was worth it.
Trying to remember all the options I have but includes:
JCW, Chili pack, Media pack XL, tech pack, auto tailgate, cruise control, auto air con, darkened glass, heated seats, heated windscreen, park assist, pedestrian alert, keyless, 18‚Äù alloys

Ordered 2nd Dec 2017 and was quoted Feb/March. I had them delay until March so I could get an 18 plate.

Drove the first week without charging it as I was waiting for a longer lead (have now ordered a Pod point). I think I did around 200 miles in week one and had topped up half tank within a few days Am getting much better mpg (currently at 41) now I‚Äôve started using the charger and the battery range seems to be getting better too (only got about 13 miles today).

When you say low, do you mean by % left or miles left? If you are getting a message saying ‚Äòlow battery‚Äô, then no, I haven‚Äôt seen this.

I am getting to work (15 miles) with between 3 and 6 miles left on the range, depending on how heavy the traffic is, with current ambient temperatures at around 5c.

I can charge both ends of my journey and having the climate control on instantly knocks 3 miles off the range - I don‚Äôt tend to have that on unless it is really cold or it is misting up inside, as the heated seats do a lovely job of warming you up without using too much juice, if you need them. 

The pre-conditioning melted the frost for me this morning so no need for a heated windscreen and meant the car was nice and toasty when I got in.

Current mpg is 99.7, but that will drop as I have longer motorway journeys tomorrow and Friday and I have only covered 450 miles so far, nearly all on electric.

When petrol power is called upon, it really does shift and 60mph came up very rapidly indeed the other day (on the right road of course). It felt like the official 0-60 of 6.8 seconds is a little bit on the conservative side.

Interesting point about the climate control/heated seats. I like to have a warm blower on my feet as they get cold so I will have to live with losing a few miles of range!

And yes, does it shift...oh boy! I tried it out on an empty road and had the feeling of being thrown back in my seat with g force (well almost ).

My previous car was a beetle which I had for 10 years and you sit quite low down and in the middle of the car, my beast is very high up and near the windscreen in comparison but I love that feeling.

Ah yes, I long for a heated steering wheel too  also preferably one in non leather as I don‚Äôt do leather (my interior is cloth/leatherette). Even better would be a 100% vegan car but they‚Äôre a rare thing.

I did see your earlier post about the red being vetoed, luckily for me I‚Äôve only myself to please so I got whatever colour I wanted  I did ponder some of the other colour choices when I went to buy it but I had already decided on red (and the multitude of options!).

My mini isn‚Äôt that much longer than my beetle, maybe by a foot, but it feels and looks so much bigger. It is definitely far pokier (and heavier).

I also had a little spend up on the mini website buying things like rubber mats (I drag a lot of mud into my car on a daily basis), and roof rack and bike rack. I‚Äôve spent quite the small(!) fortune on my beast 

I have noticed a couple of occasions where people haven‚Äôt heard me driving my car behind them, and yesterday, a squirrel ran across my path (on a private track) and I had to wait until it had realised I might be a danger and it needed to get out of the way, it was being far too casual!

Just thought about the ‚Äòcharge immediately‚Äô bit - I think that refers to your settings for when you plug in - if you go to the menu where you choose to charge immediately or set the departure time, it will have a tick (or blob) against charge immediately.

Mondays to Fridays I leave home / work at more or less the same time, so I set the departure time and the pre-conditioning in that menu and change it to charge immediately if I go elsewhere to plug in. 

Not sure why it would say low battery unless it always says that when it is below a certain percentage? But it shouldn‚Äôt say that if you have a full charge.

I had a good go in the snow for fun and the ALL4 worked brilliantly. Did you turn on the dynamic traction control? One click of the traction toggle and it goes into a 'slippy surface' mode. If you have the tech in action screen up on the centre console you will see when the rear wheels are being driven. It happens a lot, the yellow boost light on the power gauge only comes on at close to max throttle so is not the indicator for AWD (just for clarity, you probably new that). I have never seen the battery level go below 3% so there is always enough for a bit of AWD. If you were to drive up a slippery hill perpetually then eventually that will be an issue but I can't imagine that happens very often.

If you also put the gear stick into 'manual' and select sport mode the engine will never shut off. Makes for good getaways in the dry and some nice sideways action in the snow! Put the centre console surround light into 'rev counter' and you know when to change gear. I know our cars are not really designed for that sort of thing but from experience it is certainly possible.

OK, another big problem - you don't use a service log book (if you check you will find you don't get one with the car), instead a record has to be made of the service in the vehicle's internal information system (under vehicle status in my mini). Halfords don't have the ability to do this. SO now I have to take the car back to the Mini dealer, get them to update the service history in the car's computer, then present the invoice for their services to Halfords. now taken me 3 days for a routine service..... you might say I should stick to the mini dealer, but it is illegal for dealers to lock you into them for repairs and service, it is anti-competitive behaviour.

Name: Unnamed: 0, dtype: int64",14321,"Apr 5, 2018","OK here is my full experience, which is bad, but I hope I save you all a lot of time and energy. You will notice you don't get a service history log book with your car. Everything is now in the car's computer system, which can only be updated by Mini/BMW. There are 2 areas in the My Mini to look out for, (i) the service light saying how far to go before next service, which appears when you first power-up the car and (ii) the service history section, which replaces the paper service history log book where you would previously collect all your stamps as evidence of servicing. As you will all have bought your cars from new then you will find there is already an entry in the service history record for the original dealer check before delivery of the vehicle. 

Mini quoted me ¬£340 for the first service, but as they don't do anything to the electric motor, I thought why not just go to an independent instead, and Halfords quoted ¬£195 for a full service (I already drove over 11,000 miles since last Sept. but the service light didn't go off). The service was delayed a day because, in order to avoid invalidating the warranty, Halfords had to get the oil filter and air filter from the BMW main dealer anyway. When I finally picked up the car, I checked and they hadn't updated the service history (they had updated the service 'lights' for the next service, next oil change, etc). They then told me they don't have the software to do this, but go back to the Mini dealer and ask them if they will update the service history using their software, and if they charge, then Halfords would cover the cost. The mini dealer point blank refused to do this (which is kind of understandable). While I was there the service desk at the dealer put my key into his computer and got access to all my vehicle data (so yes, they do download all your data to their central system and your data is stored in your key). I told him that in my opinion replacing the paper service history log book with this computer system was in effect anti-competitive behaviour, which naturally he denied. The warranty terms are quite clear, your warranty will not be invalidated if you go to a non-Mini service provider as long as they use parts of a similar spec. 

So the question I am pursuing now is twofold, (i) do Mini/BMW allow independent service providers access to the in-vehicle computer-based service history or not,in the manual it suggests they do on page 118. It is possible Halfords can but just the centre I went to don't know how , and (ii) the problem I then have is that the simple one-liner 'full service' description of the service from Halfords does not fulfil Mini's requirements for the warranty protection, as they want a full break down of what parts were used, what lubes, etc.

Therefore you probably all want to just go back to the main dealer for the service!

A couple of other things, (i) nowhere can I find written down the service intervals, it only seems to appear when you power-up the vehicle in the display, so (ii) can anyone who has not had a service yet check for me what does yours say? Is it saying 11,000 miles to the first service? Or is it counting down? The mini guy insisted it should be counting down but my recollection (it has been wiped now by the Halfords guys) is that mine was always stuck on 11,000",1,0.0

I understood that servicing was condition-based, therefore the count should go down as your miles go up, and, if it is similar to my previous car, a BMW, if you tend to sit in lots of traffic, the countdown will hasten, and instead of a service due every 19000 miles, it could be every 17000, as in my case. I was also advised by a BMW dealer not to book a service until the counter was at, or very near, zero, as they allow 500 miles for the counter to read minus / red. 

I have not yet covered 1000 miles in my MINI, so my counter is still on 19000 miles to service.

The reason I asked about the TLC pack was because I was quoted ¬£399 for a 3 year plan, which, based on my annual mileage of 10000, effectively buys me one service, so paying the ad hoc service cost would appear to be the cheaper option for me.

I don‚Äôt fancy the shenanigans you have gone through, however, so thanks for the report! 

Thanks to having the BMW beforehand I already knew that the key gets put in to a machine to be read and data downloaded each time you visit the main dealer. 

Your counter definitely should not be stuck on 11000, especially as you drive higher than average miles I would expect the counter to change every few weeks or a month at most.",0,2016065.0

My situation is that this is actually my wife's car, but she refuses to get involved in its servicing or any other mechanical issues, so she left me to deal with that. However, as I don't drive it every day, then I was unfamiliar with the fact that it displays the service interval when you first power it up. I was just looking in the My Mini section at the various service lights for engine oil, etc and these also don't seem to count down. I think one of these was set to 11,000. Maybe the service interval light on power-up displayed 19,000 like you say yours does.

Right, get you. Still odd about the countdown being stuck on 11000 - that sounds like it needs looking at otherwise you will never know when the car needs servicing unless you do it annually which goes against the conditioned-based requirements anyway.

It probably needs a software update.

I did a personal lease (PCH) and the dealer didn‚Äôt try to push one single thing on to me, but I had a similar thing when we got my wife‚Äôs Golf on a PCP 2 years ago - they make a massive mark-up on these extras so they are keen to push them.

The paint protection is a waste of time; I have found that waxing the car once a year (Bilt Hamber double speed wax) does a very similar job, for about ¬£16 and an hour‚Äôs effort! A can of 3M fabric protector spray will protect your interior - ¬£4 and takes 2 x 5 minutes of effort. 

The tub of Bilt Hamber will easily cover 1 wax a year so ¬£16 + ¬£4 x 3 (for the 3M) = ¬£28 for 3 years of protection against what, ¬£400 for paint and interior package they wanted to throw at you?",0,0.0

Quick question - on the charging menu on the screen you have three charge options: 

Slow
Medium 
Fast

Currently its set at slow charging. I have two Mini cables, one which uses the Type 2 Polar sockets at Waitrose & the home plug charger, which currently I have to use via an extension cable in the garage. (keeps tripping the mains!!)

Can someone tell me do I need to leave the charge setting on slow or should this be switched to medium or fast?

I also notice even when the charger says the car is fully charged - it still only shows the battery is 50% in the rev counter bit.",0,0.0

Sean, Phev finally arrived! - Ordered it in January from Rybrook Worcester. It was set for a march 1st delivery, but this got delayed until April 12th - due to them having to replace the ECU. The dealer was fantastic & leant me a bmw 5 series x drive to use for the 6 weeks. and also gave me a free charging cable (165 pounds worth apparently)

First impressions of the car is that I love it. I just need to get my head round the charging & what settings to have the vehicle on. currently its on slow. 

The home charger - I just plug into a extension cable into the garage - this trips my electrics, so something isn't right there!!!.

Any advice on the charging & settings on the car to get the best economy would be great.

Got quite a big spec:

Black with black wheels & chrome extras
chili
media
tech pack
sunroof
chrome
full leather

so lots of buttons to work out & things to press!! - at first glance the apple play is amazing & the voice whatsapp messaging is cool, I will try & put some pics on when work out how too!!",2,1785657.0

Great stuff, Doggo, I will look forward to the pics when you have time.

I believe the slow setting is for when you use the 3-pin plug (granny) charger - I haven‚Äôt used mine yet. I have set my charging rate to maximum, as I usually charge at home via my Pod Point, at work (also Pod Point) and out and about using the public charger - and yes, these cables are listed at ¬£165, although I got mine posted from BMW Sytner Coventry for ¬£155, and I see they have gone down to ¬£150, so you got a good deal there, either way! 

I don‚Äôt know if the slow setting has a bearing on what you are seeing, but that doesn‚Äôt seem right. I only did a partial charge yesterday and I had 84% showing, so your 50% can‚Äôt be right, assuming it has actually charged fully - what range, in miles, is showing once you have charged? I am getting around 22 miles in the current milder weather.

I haven‚Äôt experimented too much with the different settings, and leave it in ‚Äòmid‚Äô most of the time, and flick it into Sport when the electrons have run out! On the green setting, the car will coast like a normal ICE car, and it is noticeable when in mid setting that you can feel the brake regeneration going on.

I have only filled up with petrol once since I got the car and on that tank I have covered 565 miles with a range still showing of 110 miles; the trip computer is showing an average mpg of 91.6 - I am pretty happy with that! 

Charging both ends of my work commute plus topping up at free public chargers whenever I can has helped me to get to that figure. 

I managed to bury the throttle from traffic lights on to a 70mph dual carriageway yesterday (in Sport mode) and the car is very rapid up to that limit with absolutely no drama or protests from any of the tyres - it is very impressive.

Enjoy, and let us know about the % issue!

Congrats on the new car 

I‚Äôm still waiting on my Pod Point Installation so I am still using the 3 pin charger which I guesstimate charges at around 15% per hour (on the low setting). How long are you charging it for? I think others have used a higher setting when charging on 3 pin but I don‚Äôt believe you are meant to (and it‚Äôd not worth the risk to try it in my book).

I also don‚Äôt use an extension cable, I went to the expense of buying a longer cable as I read or heard somewhere that the charges should not be plugged into an extension cable and there is the risk of overheating (and starting a fire).

Yep, I use Car Play. It is fairly limited in what it can do, however, it is really handy sending quick voice messages and I have Apple Music so it all integrates very smoothly and the fact it is wireless is one up on my wife‚Äôs Golf, so you don‚Äôt have to think about it as it hooks up to Car Play as soon as you get in the car.

You can get WhatsApp on it but that is a bit hit and miss with understanding commands or reading out messages so iMessage is much better. 

There are some other apps, such as Spotify, for example and some radio stations, but I haven‚Äôt used any of those ones.

I don‚Äôt know how it compares to Android though - wouldn‚Äôt the features be roughly the same?

I have left my phone in the armrest about 6 times so far; a couple of those times was at work where I had climbed 6 flights of stairs (my nod at keeping fit) only to have to go back down and fetch it. Still my stairs count on my phone was pretty good on those days! 

It is odd I keep doing it, as in my old BMW I always put the phone in the armrest and rarely forgot it - the only reason I can think of is that in the BMW I had to physically plug the phone in to get to my music as that didn‚Äôt work on Bluetooth whereas with the MINI it is all Bluetooth and I only plug in if I need to charge the phone.

Hi - I am three days into a week long test with the Countryman PHEV as a potential company car.

I'm a little confused re how and when to use the various drive modes, i.e. max e drive, save, etc.

The same applies to sport, green and mid.

Is there a rule of thumb approach for combining these settings?

So far the batteries do not seem to recharge very much in auto e and get depleted pretty quickly, which seems to defeat the object. I've driven a Prius before and it seemed to keep a continuous stream of charge when driving around.

That said, I am still surprised that the hybrid system doesn't regenerate the battery very well. My experience is that once your battery has run out in auto e mode the system just doesn't seem to bring it back up to w useful level.

For the driving modes, if you can plug in often (I can) then leave it in Auto - upto about 55mph it will use electric. Recharging is pretty limited, and only when you are slowing down.
If you want to recharge more then use Save or Sport - almost 100% petrol, and it recharges constantly. I prefer Sport because it sharpens the throttle response and much stronger regeneration - you don't need the brakes much.

Hi, the key to extending battery life is to keep the AC switched off. In my experience this gives an extra 30-40% of battery range. If you want quicker regeneration of the battery then put it into Sport mode, which seems strange I know, but it charges pretty rapidly, but at the cost of economy. When charging at home then if you have a 16amp cable fitted it takes 2 hours 15 mins to recharge to 100%. So it all depends on your daily commute, if you are within say 20 miles and have charging at other end then you can get almost limitless mileage. However, if you are say 40 miles with no charging at other end then fuel economy will be maybe 45mpg. But if you are using it not for work but just running errands, school trips, etc then you should be able to stay almost fully on electric.",1,2114777.0

I think you are overestimating the role of the electric battery in this car. It is quite short range, 12 - 15 miles, and flicks over to petrol seamlessly, so most people won't be driving it for the purpose of maxing out the electric mileage, for that you need to buy a pure electric car. This kind of PHEV is more about reducing local emissions pollution, local noise pollution, running around locally, but not really for longer distance driving.

I was seriously considering the Passat GTE but was a bit over my budget as a company car. Final choice was between the Outlander and the Countryman, and a test drive over a full weekend made that choice a lot easier.

I ordered the car in April and should be delivered end of August. Spec details are:
- White (free option at that time with Red)
- Black roof, black mirror caps, black roof bars, black tinted windows, model designation deletion 
- JCW Chili Pack, 18"" thrill wheels with run flats
- Harman Kardon pack
- Cross Punch Leather, carbon black
- Front & Rear parking sensors + Park assist system
- Rear armrest with storage

I really can't wait to receive it and look forward to sharing with you all a bit more here.

One feature I really liked on the outlander was the 'Charge' mode using the petrol engine and regeneration to charge the battery - and I believe this is not possible on the Mini, only 'Save'?
Do you have any feedback on the best way (if any) to charge the battery while running on petrol? Does it go up quite quickly?
Also, when the battery is flat, does the car still operate in a 'Start & Stop' way in traffic and on electric mode on the first few mph?

Welcome Toinoucos. Great spec and I look forward to the pics, I like pics.

The quickest way to charge is in Sport mode: on a recent short motorway journey I recovered 8 miles of charge in around 20 or so miles (slight guess there), then flicked it into Max e-mode for the last 8 miles of my journey. The overall mpg for that journey was 65.5 (56 miles in total). Whilst in Sport mode the mpg will drop alarmingly, however. I would have to do the same journey again just using Auto mode to see the difference.

Auto mode also recovers miles but at a much slower rate. There may be others on here who do longer motorway journeys who have tried various methods to eek out the mpg. I know from two earlier journeys I did, one fully laden, that I achieved 38mpg on one, and 42mpg on the other using Auto mode when the electricity ran out, but they were much longer trips. I‚Äôm going on a 500 mile round trip in July and I am going to try the Sport mode / Max e-mode combo to see if it achieves a better result than 42mpg.

My commute to work is 15 miles each way and I can charge both ends of my journey (key to max mpg) and I can do 100% of my journey on Max e-mode as this mode keeps it in purely electric unless you plant your foot and then the petrol engine kicks in. You can combine Max e-mode with Sport mode so you drive in electric (up to motorway speeds if you want to) and have the weightier feel of Sport. In purely electric driving, whilst not scintillating, it is surprisingly nippy, and easily keeps up with the flow of traffic - the instant torque helps there.

Green mode is a bit too fluffy for me but you can coast like a normal ICE car when you lift off - I rarely use it so I am not sure of the true benefits.

If you don‚Äôt want to faff toggling through the various modes, Auto is a good compromise. 

I haven‚Äôt used the Save mode yet but the car will always save a little bit of electricity when you get down to low speeds but only enough for a mile or two.

In Sport mode the engine will switch off if sitting at traffic lights, for example, but the engine soon kicks in when you start to move off unless you are crawling at 2 mph.

Sport mode is highly addictive by the way - the engine sounds great and the car is incredibly well-planted when rocketing away from lights (all within the legal limits, officer).

I don‚Äôt think you will be disappointed and you will love the Harmon Kardon sound system.

Hi @Toinoucos firstly welcome to the EV fold.
I have seen adverts recently extolling the virtues of ""charging whilst you drive"" from various ""hybrid"" manufacturers.
It is their way of selling a poorly designed hybrid that still relies on the ICE for most if not all motoring.

In reality there is no reason to do this as it is not as efficient as simply driving on the ICE due to losses and the vastly higher cost of fuel to do so. Electricity is around 10% of the price of fuel. Why charge the car in this fashion when all you need to do is plug in at night.
You may as well have a straight ICE.

Hold though is great so you can drive around town as an EV, blast down a motorway on the ICE in Hold mode and have power left to go back to EV mode at the other end.

Regen will always be active and put energy back in to the battery, even when using the ICE and I suppose it works exactly the same way on the Mini as on the Volt/Ampera. The ICE will chime in and out as energy is regenerated or required to drive the car.

Have fun and plug in.",1,2294730.0

Hi Sean,
Many thanks for all the details. Will definitely give the sport mode a go for quicker regeneration. During my long test drive I must confess I spent a fair time of it in sports mode... It's a surprisingly powerful car and will pull away at red lights at an amazing pace, EV torque helping.

I will be interested to hear your feedback as you try different things; as I tend to do very long motorway journeys (London - Leeds, London - Manchester, London - Paris ...).

Regarding Harman Kardon... Can't wait. It usually offers a decent performance so will look forward to trying it.

Hi Russ,
I fully agree with you.

That being said I'm in a slightly unique setup. I've go no plugin facilities at home (renting in west London) nor at work.
I really enjoy cruising on EV in the city, especially in London but was afraid I would not have battery left at the end of my journeys. Furthermore, I'm also a company car driver with a fuel card (= free fuel) so do not particularly mind slightly higher consumption if it means a smooth drive and no emissions once in town.

The main differences I see in my case is that the mini happens to have a charging cable in the boot (vs. usual hybrids) meaning a lower BIK rate vs hybrids and furthermore ICE

I'm really excited though to join the PHEV community, this is my first hybrid and surely not my last. I really enjoy the comfort, especially at low speeds, the torque, and the reduced emissions !

Good to see they are also including the dimming mirrors - I couldn‚Äôt justify adding those as extra cost as well when I ordered mine!

I have no regrets taking the MINI, though - it has been fault-free (OK, I‚Äôm only 4 months in!) and a superb drive, with plenty of power when you want it.

I‚Äôve no doubt the Golf would have been a great car (and a fair bit cheaper to lease as well) and the only nagging doubt I had was that by the time I would have got it, the Mk8 would soon be out. I see on the GTE forum some people who ordered their cars in October, when I ordered mine, have only just received them! What a joke.

I recently did a 197 mile trip and averaged 52mpg. I started off with a full charge and kept it in Max e-drive until the leccy ran out then switched to Sport mode to do a bit of recharging; as soon as got around 10 miles back on the leccy range I switched back to Max e-drive and so on and so on.

That was calculated by topping up so I knew how much fuel I‚Äôd used.

I would say that on a longer journey that figure would dip and if you are regularly taking motorway trips the MINI can‚Äôt compete with efficient petrol or diesel engines which is why theses hybrids are really most suitable for urban driving with charging at both ends of your commute, unless BIK plays into your money-saving calculations, of course!

From what I have seen online the acoustic warning is for the driver, not the pedestrian and the brakes are pre-conditioned for hard braking and will take over if the driver doesn‚Äôt start to brake.

I seem to remember an option for pedestrian warning for around ¬£85 when I ordered my car and I assumed at the time it was an audible warning for pedestrians, not the driver!

Edit: from a report on BMW i cars, I am assuming the same for all BMW Group cars;

The ‚ÄúAudible Pedestrian Protection‚Äù works up to a speed of 30 km/h with a turbine-like external sound being generated. For vehicle-start, the Audible Pedestrian Protection is always active, but it can be disabled by pressing a button when silence is desired.‚Äô‚Äô

Not sure if this was one of the options you ticked or whether it is not included in the drivers assistance pack (ah, clue might be in the name?!, only drivers get the warnings), again, a bit mean of BMW if the pedestrian warning noise is not included in that pack!

My car came via Cooper Reading, and from day one they said it would be a 9 week delivery slot, and they were bang on, so hopefully your dealer has the same spooky foresight (unlike VW dealers).

The dealer will know when the car hits the production line, the point at which it can‚Äôt be altered, and from that moment on they can be pretty accurate when it will arrive in the dealership: ask the business partner at Inchcape to phone / email when the car is at that stage and then they can update you on the likely delivery date.

To get to my horse I have to go down my road (a fairly steep descent) and up one fairly steep hill plus the turning onto the private road that leads to my horse has a short slope upwards. I didn‚Äôt even attempt any of that in the bad snow last year as I was able to get a lift off someone else who lives close but it meant I had to do everything to their time and barely got time to see my horse. It was a miserable time as my horse was miserable and so I was I and barely slept for worry. I doubt we‚Äôll get snow like that for quite a while but I want to ensure that I can always make it to my horse whatever the weather. 

I have driven to my horse in the middle of a blizzard in my beetle (front wheel drive) and barely made it up the hill I mentioned. It was a scary drive I have to say. Having all wheel drive will be better. All wheel drive with winter tyres will be even better.",1,0.0

JoJo has one on here, but as I keep telling everyone, blue is best!

Only kidding, of course, I have seen two Countrymans in red, and with the black roof it looks great and with either the JCW wheels, which have red / black badges in the centres, or the black wheels, they really set it off nicely.

Look up JoJoRedMiniCountryman on here and you will see what I mean. 

The Chili red is based on the classic Mini red of course, and, just my personal opinion, with a white roof looks better on the Mini hatchback rather than the Countryman. Or just go all red. 

All non-metallics are clear coated these days which is why it looks so glossy when clean - if it was metallic, it would be a darker red, probably, perhaps like the Soul Red on Mazdas.

As for chargers, I can only go by my experience of Pod Point - I chose them because I preferred the look of it (unless you want to spend stupid money on an Andersen) compared to others.

On this general forum you will see a few stories about the Rolecs being a bit unreliable, but as far as I can tell the early problems have been resolved. In theory, there is nothing much to go wrong, but maybe they used cheap or sub-standard parts in the earlier versions.

I‚Äôve only been using the Pod Point for 5 months and so far, no issues at all - I went for a 32a tethered unit - I went tethered as a few people mentioned on here it is a faff when dark / wet / cold routing around plugging in so I went for the easy option! 

Remember, for the Countryman you will need a separate type 2 to type 2 public charger cable, which costs about ¬£140, if you want to charge at work or out shopping.

My hindsight moment was getting my Pod Point installed last November when I was expecting my Golf GTE to be delivered the following February! There was a rumour that the Government might pull or reduce the incentive for home charging points; they didn‚Äôt and I cancelled the GTE anyway as delivery went out to at least June (judging by some others on the forum, I would eventually have got it in October).

As you only have 5 weeks to go, and if you have it confirmed that your car is in production, or you already have your VIN, you can safely arrange installation. I think Pod Point would need a week or two‚Äôs notice if you want to be charging from day one. The forms are quite straightforward to fill out but Pod Point can help if you have any issues.

A big consideration will be ease of installation at your property - I was lucky in that my house is only 8 years old so has up to date wiring, fuses etc and the consumer unit is at the front of the house with a drive way where the standard 5m cable reaches to the charging socket with no problem, when I have reversed in, so it was an easy install for the fitter. 

I have had no issues with my Pod Point but have had no dealings with any others; as a company they are very easy and helpful to deal with so I wouldn‚Äôt hesitate to recommend them.

Rolec are traditionally cheaper but have had reliability issues in the past - there are plenty of threads and posts on this forum about them and other makes. Zappi seem to be popular with people who also have solar panels as they can link them up, so to speak. 

I don‚Äôt think you can call the wall chargers pretty by any means, although if you do want something sleek or funky you can get an Andersen or a BMW unit, but they will cost a fortune and essentially do the same job!",0,2352546.0

Hi JoJo - yes, I get a full charge after 2 hrs and 15 mins or so, depending on what is left before I plug in, so it doesn‚Äôt sound right for your charge - you haven‚Äôt got a time set for departure have you? I forgot to change to ‚Äòcharge immediately‚Äô once or twice in the early days and had a similar issue to yours.

I have had one public charger failure, at Tesco, where after an hour I only got 3 miles extra added but when I plugged in at home, all was fine.

Also, when you plug in, the plug symbol will appear in your central speedo along with a time stating when the car will be fully charged - when you next plug in just wait a few seconds to see if this appears and what time it states. 

When you unlocked your car after you thought it had charged did you notice if the coloured ring on the car charge port glowed green as usual, or when you locked the car at the start of charging did you notice the colour then? It was probably green at the start otherwise it wouldn‚Äôt have charged at all, I imagine. 

The only other thing I can think of is maybe there was a power cut mid-way through and this upset it although I would have thought you might have noticed clocks flashing indoors if that had happened. 

And then one final thought is have you got a public charger near you you can pop down to to check it charges ok on there? After half an hour you should gain 5 miles and this would be a checker to ensure it is taking on charge ok.

Sorry, one final, final thought for now, are you able to charge with the granny cable? If you can, try that to rule out an issue with your Pod Point. I used the granny cable for the first time a couple weeks ago at a car park in Kingston where they had 3 three-pin plugs and it charged at the same rate as the normal cable and no over-heating on the granny itself.",1,2353544.0

It's averaging around 50mpg (indicated) which I know is meaningless, but in general seems to be using about what I thought it would. For me, the BIK savings make it worth it and I'm happy with my fuel costs 1,500 miles in. Had I not been able to get the Mini PHEV on the company scheme I would have likely taken a car allowance and looked at something like a VW Golf GTi, so it compares fairly well on a fuel usage front and everyday performance is not far off, if not better!

As for mpg, the only true way to calculate it is to do the maths when you fill up.

Once I added in electricity costs, that came down to 63mpg. 

When I do longer, work related journeys I am getting 43-ish to the gallon, but as I am reclaiming fuel costs I am not too bothered.

For comparison, my BMW diesel did around 60 to 63 on long trips and an overall economy of 52mpg.

That would make sense, I changed from back Android to iPhone (partly because of CarPlay). My Android phone says 99.9mpg - one of the few times an app works better on Android than iPhone! 

I bought an iPhone 8 Plus which of course doesn‚Äôt fit the wireless charging armrest  I think the iPhone XS Max might just fit however I can‚Äôt buy that in red to match my car (yes, I really did do that ).

You‚Äôre right about app usage though, I only really use it to add destinations as it‚Äôs easier than trying to input it directly into the car. Speaking of the nag, I drove somewhere I hadn‚Äôt been for a while on Saturday and didn‚Äôt know they had removed a roundabout and added in a turn off instead. My sat nav clearly didn‚Äôt know that either and though I saw the signs saying turn off, my car didn‚Äôt so I ended up not taking it and then had to take the next turning.

Not unless you want to stop for two hours and then only get 20 miles down the road before the juice runs out. The motorway chargers are really the preserve of the electric-only brigade, who can get around 80% of their needs in about 45 minutes. 

When I do my motorway runs I switch to Sport mode which then regenerates about 9 miles of electric only power, use that up on electric only then switch back to Sport - it gives you something to do to relieve the boredom, if nothing else - I have averaged around 52mpg using that method and slightly less just letting Auto do its thing. 

If you can‚Äôt charge up at all then you will probably average low 40s mpg, which isn‚Äôt that bad considering my wife‚Äôs Golf 1.4 auto does mid 40s on a motorway run.

If you can sort out a decent extension lead you can use your granny charger st work, if they let you, and that will help a bit.",0,2379136.0

I am happy with that since it is also great to drive. 

I also took it on the North Coast 500. Highly recommended. Amazing drive and great car to do it in. Think the mpg took a big hit as mostly in sport didn't charge and ended up doing 1000 miles with all the extra bits. 

On the subject. Sport mode is too addictive . I also like how the interior mood lights flash red briefely when you select it.",1,0.0

The battery capacity is 7.6kWh and it charges at 3.7kW per hour therefore 2 hours 15 for a full charge.

If your electricity rate is 15p per kW, it would cost ¬£1.14 per charge. 

As for extension cables, they should be of good quality and fully unwound to prevent heat build up (you should do that whatever you are using it for, especially over a long period of time) and weather proof, of course.

I would just advocate not to use a cheap extension cable as that is likely to overheat and can cause a trip.

The average is actually 79p per charge based on my tariff of 12.07p per kWh plus the standing charge, which I have had to do a rough, back-of-a-***-packet calculation for of 2.31p per hour = 14.38p.

With the A Class, so far anyway, Mercedes have kept the models and packages to a minimum; leaving the various states of tune for the petrol and diesel engines, you order an SE, a Sport or an AMG Line model. You can then add Executive, Premium or Premium Plus to the Sport or the AMG Line. Done. 

We looked at a T-Roc R Line as well - despite being at the top of the pecking order, you then need to tick many boxes to get to the Premium level of equipment, making the car a lot more expensive than the A Class. 

German manufacturers have been doing this for decades - I remember when a radio was extra! Until recently, Germans favoured functionality over add-ons, such as sunroofs and alloy wheels. UK spec Golf GTis inthe 80s cane much better equipped than their German counterparts.

So if your employer gives you a car as part of the package, i understand there is a taxable value of that car, and a % applied to the value to say how much benefit you had this year, so if my Mini's taxable value was ¬£33,000 and the rate is 13% then I'd pay tax on (33k x 13%)= 4,290, whereas the diesel model of the countryman looks to be more like 27%, so (26k x 27%) = 7,020, which you would pay tax on. So you can have a nicer, greener car for less tax.

then on the mileage, you can get 15p/mile up to the fuel benefit cap of (23,400 x 13%) = 3,042, is that right? Although for pure electric BEVs (not Minis) this is going to be set at zero, and you can only claim 4p/mile?",1,0.0

With BIK if the calculation is ¬£4,290, as above, you would pay 20% or 40% on that value so ¬£860 or ¬£1720 (roughly) per annum.

On mileage, the current cap is 45p per mile so a company can pay anything between 45p and the minimum (I think it is 11p for company cars); my company pays 14p as I have a ‚Äòcash in lieu‚Äô car - it is down to me to then make the claim for the difference annually to HMRC, who then adjust the tax code for the following year - you get the tax relief at 20% or 40% not the cash difference between the min and the max mileage allowances. If your claim is above ¬£2k you will need to hand over proof of journeys whereas under they take your word for it but obviously they can check with your company that you have made the claims (and the company has paid you).

Therefore, if you could have claimed ¬£2k on fuel from your company and your company reimbursed you only ¬£500, you would get 20% or 40% tax relief on the ¬£1500, adjusted in your salary.

Name: Unnamed: 0, dtype: int64",40649,"Oct 11, 2018","The Advisory Electricity Rate (AER) has been introduced on BEVs at 4p per mile after lobbying by representatives of fleet owners as the Government now recognises that if employers pay up to this rate there is no profit for the employee and therefore no tax or NI needs to be paid. If an employer pays more than the AER they would have to prove no profit is being gained by the employee (e.g cost per kWh is more than 4p per mile equivalent). 

The reason for the lobbying is because large fleet operators have been reluctant to add BEVs as there was no equivalent to the AFR (advisory fuel rate for petrol / diesel vehicles) so employees didn‚Äôt have a real incentive to jump out of petrol or diesel cars to BEVs and which may also explain why hybrids are popular (not to mention range anxiety of fully electric cars) as BIK rates are, for now, much lower.

I read elsewhere today that the Government is thinking of withdrawing the plug in grant and reducing the BEV grant - I am not sure the take up of EVs is sufficient to warrant that yet, and would surely cause people to plod on with petrol / diesel engined vehicles, unless your in the generous BIK scheme?

Name: Unnamed: 0, dtype: int64",65169,"Oct 18, 2018","So it's been three weeks since the car arrived and I've done a couple of medium / long trips. I think I'm getting my head round to get the most out of the various combinations of drive modes, but thought I'd check in with you guys, who have been using their cars for a bit longer.

My usage is split as follows:

1. Generally short runs most of the week, so I charge at home every couple of days and run on Max E Drive, Green or Mid (seems to be no difference) - thoughts on this?

2. The odd 200 / 300 mile business trip, where I can only charge at home, no other charging options. For this I tend to use Max E Drive until the battery is depleted. I then switch to Save mode and Mid or Sport to get the battery back up to circa 60% - 70%, this gives around 10 miles for Max E Drive again. I keep repeating this.

I'm still to crunch the MPG numbers, but for now some questions on the above - is this the best way to run the car if you can only charge one end?

Also, am I actually getting any benefit from doing the whole alternating between Max E Drive and Save Mode or should I just keep it on Auto and stop faffing?

If in max e mode I don‚Äôt think there is any difference / point to switch to green or mid, though you can put it in Sport to get the extra weight and feel while still in electric mode. If in petrol mode you can switch to Green and the regen switches off so you ‚Äòfreewheel‚Äô when lifting off and therefore saving a bit of fuel.

On longer business trips where I can only charge one way I do the faffing with Sport mode to regen the electric mode - I crunched numbers before and I think you can a handful of mpg this way but you could leave it in auto and it will regen, albeit far more slowly.

As my longer trips are business ones I am claiming the fuel back anyway and the 14p a mile I get covers actual fuel used with a couple of quid over and above.",0,2402654.0

If you are driving in Auto then flick between Green, Mid and Sport there are certainly differences in engine response once off electric.

The steering weighting is the major difference and the regeneration is notably different between Sport and Mid, and as mentioned before, in Green you can coast freely.

In the grand scheme of things I don‚Äôt think it has a massive impact on efficiency - Auto probably covers most situations adequately and Sport is great fun if you are in the mood, with sharper responses and a bit of fruitiness from the exhaust.

Green mode is too light on steering and responses are dulled so I avoid that one.",1,2402844.0

Did you have the climate control / A/c on? That knocks around 6 miles off initially.

Also, did you pre-condition the car? If not, set a departure time so the car is heated up before you get in and it doesn‚Äôt drain the electric range - but then you would need to turn the climate off and put the heated seats on to keep you warm otherwise you will see the range drop again - it depends on how cold you feel whether you need the heat on: I prefer a slightly cooler cabin and unless it is bitterly cold I never drive with a coat or jacket on.

Also, if you have the heating on initially, then the cabin warms up to a comfortable temperature you can switch off and regain a few miles of range.

My usual range is 21 miles initially - in the recent warmer weather, last weekend for example, and last night leaving work, I was showing 23 miles of range. It‚Äôs strange, but when the ambient temperature is around 18c I get longer range - maybe it is a sweet spot for the battery, I‚Äôm not sure.

Thing is I didn‚Äôt really do my research before order and did it on back of short test drive so have some questions/ concerns if you can help......although too late now if the answers don‚Äôt suit! Ha;

How do you go about using public chargers? Are they generally free to use or do you pay? Which ones are free (assume those elctrocity ones at services aren‚Äôt!) I downloaded the zap map app....chargers seem to be bit thin on the ground up north!

Understand car comes with 3 pin plug charger. Can this be used at public chargers? If not do you get the public charger lead with car?

How long is the 3 pin lead? Bit concerned even if i can get the car up the bloody drive (see point below) that my external socket is too far away to charge for lead....on that note is charger socket only on one side of car?

I am lead to believe from posts that wing mirrors aren‚Äôt auto fold in as standard - approx how wide is Car with mirrors out? My drive is VERY tight and auto mirrors would‚Äôve given me a few precious cm to play with without winding windows down! (I leave present Car roadside now because it‚Äôs such a squeeze)

My general commute is 10 mile each way so possibly doable on electric only (in summer?) however I do travel with work, usually 4-500 mile plus trips every 2-3 weeks where charging will probably be unlikely with stay over in b&b etc. This would likely mean regenerative power to battery only. What sort of range is likely on full tank - I have seen some complaints on small tank and don‚Äôt fancy extortionate service station prices!

There is a bmw/ mini franchise around 15 min walk from work which also has charger - can anyone use these charge points? This would be ideal for me - free parking and a charge! Bit cheeky and not sure I would get away with it....not for any period of time anyway haha

Anyone else notice the US reviews all claim 12 mike range only but UK reviews say 20-26? 

Aside from this looking forward to collection although wish I could‚Äôve chosen few options to the standard set up.....still even standard should be better than my present in Car (lack of!) entertainment!

To answer a couple of Q's, the folding mirrors come with the Chili Pack and they don't stick out as much as I expected - haven't measured them though! The US cars have a battery half the size I believe.

My Fleet team (who are otherwise useless) managed to pre-book a large number of build slots so mine has only taken around 10 weeks from order to being ready for delivery.

Good choice IMO! I love mine

Few answers below:

1. Public chargers aren't really worth it in my opinion unless it's a destination charge and you're going to be there for 3 hours plus. A charge at a Motorway Service station is going to add 1 or 2 miles tops (unless you're there for hours)

2. I believe the public charge lead is an extra although my company provided for me - I've not used it yet though!

3. Standard 3 pin is 5m I believe. Charge socket is on the front left wing of the car. We had to rearrange how we park our cars on the drive to make it reach. Understand some people use extension leads, but I'd be nervous about that in the long term!

4. Nope, folding wing mirrors is an extra, possibly in the Chilli pack? I've not got them

5. Range on a full tank with one charge is a difficult one. Depends a lot on your driving style, what type of roads you'll be using. I've seen about 300 miles on the one time that I've done it. I do a lot of 400 mile trips for work (one day, round trip) and will get to my destination with a third or so left and fill up before I leave my destination. Fuel tank is only 35 litres, so although you'll spend more time filling up, each fill is cheaper (in my experience anyway!).

6. Not sure about the BMW/Mini charge points. I'm lucky that my company has a large car park and an external 3 in socket they let me use every day (proper charge points due to be installed next week!)

7. I noticed this, but I get between 17-21 miles of range on a full charge with the heater off - noticed it going towards the lower end as mornings get colder - time to break out the winter coats!

The standard entertainment system is fine in my opinion. If you have an iphone, the carplay system is generally ace!",5,2407366.0

I reverse in and the cable is just long enough to reach - the Pod Point is set back from the furthest point I can reverse to by a couple of feet / 80cm. Reversing in is a lot easier than reversing out!

Apparently, the Countryman is 2005mm wide including the door mirrors: surprisingly, it is not as wide as my wife‚Äôs Mk 7 Golf at 2027mm (approx 1 inch). But if you exclude the mirrors the Mini is 1821mm wide versus the Golf at 1799mm, again roughly an inch in it. 

The reversing camera is extremely useful, and it has green and red guide lines to see you back up correctly. 

Not sure what the width is when the mirrors are folded, though, somewhere in between obviously! But as long as your driveway is more than 2005mm wide you‚Äôll be fine: might be a bit squeaky bum time though ha ha.",0,2408280.0

The dimming / folding mirrors would have been around ¬£500 extra, so if you add the XL screen, the difference is an extra ¬£700 or so more if you specced the same car six months ago.

But I agree that the Chili pack is a must, if you can afford it and the Tech is a nice to have: as well as the larger screen, HUD and Harmon Kardon system, you get an extra USB point, hard drive storage and a wireless charging dock in the armrest.

Digging up a very old post here. I really use the modes and see a great difference in them. 

Firstly all modes influence on the energy regen
GREEN tends to trigger coasting which is great to limit fuel usage but doesn‚Äôt recover energy
MID is medium regen you can feel it as a slow engine brake
SPORT is definitely an aggressive engine brake. The throttle becomes on/off with almost a brake factor if you release it. Sport mode will also regen at any RPM level maximizing the fuel usage 

GREEN mode is definitely very toned down. It has little throttle response and limits the consumption. I tend to use it on motorways as driving with cruise control mostly. The best I have managed is a 380 miles theoretical range at almost 50 MPG. Average motorway MPG being careful I would say 42-47. 

SPORT is similar as SAVE in the electric vs. gas usage as past 10MPH it switches to full ICE with electric backup for boost only. 

Using SAVE at the right time really elongates the range without sacrificing fuel economy (I.e. on cruise control flat or downhill at 50 MPH)

I remember when test driving the Mitsubishi Outlander PHEV it had pads like gear pads behind the wheel which could be used for regen levels, kinda mimicking the engine braking. This was very useful to make the most of slowing down to recharge the battery. Same can be done in the min by flicking into sports mode, especially for ‚Äúengine braking‚Äù down hill. It works very well. 

The only annoying thing is every button flick monopolizes the central display and flashes lights (green-orange-red) in the cabin which I both have found no way of turning off ... if anyone managed it I would love to hear how. 

Having no charging option at home or at work at this stage I became quite an expert at maximizing range through the different modes so happy to answer any question if needed.",3,0.0

I'm not sure why that is happening. My house supply is a pitiful 60A, and I've had the washer, dryer, oven and induction hob on whilst charging without it tripping out. All the electrics are pretty much new, and I have 2x consumer units so everything is separated out, perhaps this has helped? 

It didn't even occur to me to get the supply increased until I'd just had the driveway laid. Doh! Had to settle for a 16A charger. When I enquired about it with Western Power, they said they would increase the supply free of charge but it would involve digging up my new driveway...I think some distribution companies will upgrade you FOC if you say it's for an EV, others will charge (no pun intended).",1,0.0

In fact largest battery has regenerated on engine and save has been 30%, however, going through menu this still only indicates 4 miles electric range. Does this sound right?

On electric I use MID quite often or in town if I absolutely have to be on petrol. 
GREEN is way less responsive but also much smoother so better fuel efficiency. On motorways (most of my miles) I‚Äôm fully on GREEN. 


I charge rarely. Only motorway stations and at my girlfriends. So I try to keep the charge always around 50%, I use it only at very slow speeds and traffic jams where the electric consumption is very low but the petrol equivalent would be awful. 
And I charge it using SAVE as soon as there is a flat or downhill 20-50MPH stint of road

Hi gofer, 100% agree with you and I feel like both are features left out. 
I would totally set green to default mode and would love to change the 10 MPH EV/ICE switch for SPORT/SAVE to maybe 17 or so and the 60 MPH limit of the other modes to maybe 45 MPH ...

I hope it is something they think about for future models / versions as I feel today that the stock setting of AUTO - MID means you work on full electric unless the battery is empty, you floor it or you are on motorways, which is not really what you think of a hybrid.

At the end of this year submit a claim (online) to HMRC for the difference between the rate your company pays you and the agreed maximum set out by HMRC (mileage allowance relief), currently 45p; HMRC will then adjust your tax code in the months following April 2019 - as long as your claim is below ¬£2000, it is highly unlikely they will ask for any proof but keep all your receipts and claims to your company in case they do.

That‚Äôs pretty good and can see works well with the car. In reference to the HMRC claim, 
does that work with company cars too? I thought you could only do secondary claim if it‚Äôs your personal car? Also company keeps all receipts for their auditing purposes when we submit so don‚Äôt have physical copy of receipts - only thing would be a copy of the form minus the receipt evidence. 

The other thing with our company car scheme is that colleagues without company cars need to borrow them from time to time if they have site meetings etc. This is ok in theory (i had to plenty of times before getting a car), however, it is annoying the car starts in mid rather than green and then there are those who will flick it into sport no doubt which will hit the economy even more",1,2434386.0

I have a bit of a quirky observation with Apple CarPlay and an iPhone 8.

When using a number of apps including Spotify / Podcasts / TuneIn I can only scroll through first 12 artists / playlists etc when moving.
As soon as I am stopped (even with gearbox still in drive) I can scroll through everything.

Has anyone else noticed this? Assuming it is a safety feature, but not sure if it is implemented by Mini or Apple as I have not seen this with CarPlay in a Ford.

Also following first service, my first recharge yesterday gave me 27 miles range on departure which is the highest I've ever seen! Today I was back to 21, quite a drop, especially as it was warmer today.

Thanks!

Been out of the loop on this forum following a big trip to SE Asia. Good to catch up on all the very useful tips and tricks, as ever.

I'm enjoying the red beast. I do have a question though - does anyone know whether the BIK rate changed on these cars? I was quoted circa ¬£177 pcm by the fleet company, but having received my first payslip since taking delivery, I've noticed it's double this!!!

I noticed that at one point the Mini just crept below 50g/km of CO2 emissions, but is now rated at 55g/km. Not sure if they retested it under WLTP rather than NEDC, but it happened after I'd ordered which is annoying.

Yes, it is a safety feature to stop you from keeping your eyes off the road. It took me a couple of months to realise what the hell was going on! I have an iPhone 6s, so it is nothing to do with your phone, but inbuilt by MINI / BMW. 

The same thing happens with Google maps - if you need to type in an address, you have to be stationary to complete it. 

It makes sense but is a bit frustrating at the same time.

That seems high; also sounds like 20% / 40% rates - I was paying around ¬£170 pcm on a BMW 118D at the 40% rate - it doesn‚Äôt sound right that a hybrid would be anywhere near a dirty diesel in terms of BIK but the rates have been going up at an alarming rate (already posted years in advance).

Find out the cost of your car, including any extras, then look up the BIK rate for 2018 / 2019 and it should be easy to work out, or ask your fleet department to look at the numbers again.

Using Richard‚Äôs link, the basic cost would be ¬£1018 per year or ¬£86 per month for a 20% tax rate payer or ¬£172 for a 40% rate payer, which is close to the figure your fleet department quoted. I just cannot see that it would be double that - have they charged you for two months‚Äô worth in one go, or have you had a major change in salary or any other benefits? If your fleet department can‚Äôt give you a straight answer, get on to your tax office and ask them.

If your fleet department is anything like mine when I had a company car, you could find there was a delay in telling HMRC when you got the car to adjusting your salary. They will have a cut off date by which to tell your payroll about your new car, and if they missed that, they may have doubled up without telling you.

In the first few months of joining my company, I had a pool car for two months, then a loan car for a month before finally getting my BMW: my tax code was all over the place for a while.

I think the biggest problem with touch up paint is that it is thick and gloopy and it is so hard to get thin layers on to make it blend. Or maybe that is just my ham-fisted attempts!

Depending on the depth of the scratch you can use a scratch remover paste, followed by a polish then some wax to build up the scratch to the original paint level. You need a bit of patience and time to keep going at it.

If it is a deep scratch, one you can feel catching with your nail, then it might be too deep and that‚Äôs when the professionals need to step in. 

My wife‚Äôs Golf hatch was badly scratched by a clueless car washer at a main VW dealer - they paid for a professional detailer to look at it, and he machined-polished them out and you would never have known they were there in the first place, 

It might be worth ‚Äòbuilding up‚Äô a few more scratches then paying for a detailer to give it a good go as they can make a world of difference - bodyshops are only interested in spraying whole panels for cost and time reasons and then don‚Äôt always match up the paint properly!",1,2492250.0

@Sean Davis - Under what circumstances are you saying that the Mini had ""more grip"" than the A-Class ???

Just curious as i'm beginning to get more comfortable with the driving dynamics of the MAXI now and if you corner hard and steady state (but do it progressively - i.e. Don't overload the tyres with the initial turn-in), the car has a LOT of front end grip... much better than the NG A-Class Diesel I drove late last year (same roundabouts and stretch of B-Road).

What I still find disconcerting is the ""understeer from the rear end"" feel that I get from the car when its in 4WD operation and i'm pushing on in the twists.... that slightly artificial rear end feel (from the eMotor driving the back wheels) still translates into an initial impression that the front end doesn't have enough 'grip' as you get that classic push from the rear that the lack of physical connection front to rear and an open rear diff gives.

I want to try the 2 series BMW PHEV to see if its the same, but local dealers never have any in when I visit.... I drove an i8 a couple of years ago (same drivetrain as the MAXI, just the other way around and turned up to 11 !) and that had a really artificial feeling on the FRONT when you pushed into a roundabout, so maybe its just how our weird 4WD, but not real 4WD PHEVs are going to feel like these days ?",1,2512528.0

I‚Äôve found flick into manual and cornering in a high gear gives great cornering performance.

At 2000 rpm the ICE generates 45kw for the front wheels while the rear wheels get 65kw from the electric motor. This gives much improved front end grip. It feels a little like a rear wheel drive car while exiting corners.

In 4th gear the electric motor produces 65 kw at 1500rpm. In 6th from 1200rpm. I really wish this car didn‚Äôt kick down so easily!",1,2572954.0

I've done the ""manual"" shifting when I've had the 'rush of blood to the head late night drives home' - certainly know where you are coming from. Dynamically it reminds me of my wife's old 1 series Sport, especially on tight corner exit (around 45 - 50 mph). Still trying to get used to the fact that the 4WD is controlled by a computer rather than any mechanical / fluid connections.... it feels a bit ""control system input - think - control system react"" which makes you drive in a slightly binary fashion..... I like the basic dynamics of the car and can see what people mean by the whole ""Mini DNA"" thing, but I think I'm just going to have to put up with the compromise and just drive around its flaws.

At least the SMG function works the right way around in this car (Pull back to Change Up - Push forward to Change Down).

I have lurked here for a few weeks. I previously owned a Cooper S (late 2007), currently a 2 year old Merc B Class.

I test drove a late 2017 PHEV with decent spec (Nav +, reverse camera, chili pack) today... and I hate to say that it didn‚Äôt live up to expectations. I think it turns out that I love the idea of owning this car much more than the reality...

Key observations:

- the interior isn‚Äôt quite up to scratch for a car of this cost IMO. A lot of plastic in the one I drove and the doors/seats were solid but not quite as nice as I expected. This one wasn‚Äôt full leather, had carpet all over the door handle area which I didn‚Äôt like look of much.
- sport seat was just too firm for me. Bordering on uncomfortable.
- the 8‚Äù sat nav unit was pretty good but when using car play it gets about 5‚Äù of that space? Very small compared to the screen in my merc now.
- the ride was firm... maybe I am getting old but this felt like a car it would be hard to relax in/sit in traffic in.
- electric range was as people have posted but a 70% charge and 11 mile range did slightly underwhelm.
- performance in Sport mode was good but not ‚Äúwow‚Äù. Seemed way faster than I‚Äôd ever need but didn‚Äôt give me goosebumps.
- Auto mode engaged the engine basically immediately... not sure if when the electric motor was actually used until I selected Max-E mode
- the Qi wireless charger not fitting my iPhone (XS Max) was also very disappointing. The idea that BMW made a wireless charger that doesn‚Äôt fit iPhone + models/XS/XR (let alone many android phones) is really pathetic and a massive oversight

Positives:

- The styling is something I like and the car has an X factor which is hard to explain/quantify
- speakers (Harmon kardon) sounded good
- road noise was good


So, all in all, I was underwhelmed. I can possibly live with all the negatives apart from the seats/ride not feeling comfortable... but for ¬£30k ish it wasn‚Äôt nearly as premium as I expected.

Please help if there is something I am missing? The sales person said those are the most comfortable seats on a Mini... say it ain‚Äôt so!

It‚Äôs probably a case of personal preference. I like sitting and I don‚Äôt find my mini uncomfortable!

I‚Äôve never had a ‚ÄúPremium‚Äù car before so I have nothing to compare it with. I‚Äôve had mine a year now and the carpet on the drivers door is looking worn. I replaced my carpet mats with rubber ones (my interior gets filthy as I have a horse so come winter my car gets full of mud and bits of hay), and I also have seat cover on all my seats os they will last longer.

The phone charger is annoying, I changed from my Samsung S8 which just about fitted to an iPhone 8 Plus which doesn‚Äôt. The battery lasts well on it though so I rarely need to charge it in the car as it gets an overnight charge.

The electric range is a bit pathetic, and even worse in winter, but it suits the mileage I normally do. Sometimes the engine does come on on starting but it does then switch.

I find the car to be a really comfortable motorway cruiser as well as really chilled around town. It's silent in EV mode and very quiet in ICE unless you have it in Sport. It's much less firm than my Golf VII (GT TDi), I still wince when I see an unavoidable pothole but to my relief it doesn't feel like I'm going to lose a wheel like the Golf did. It's a million times better in traffic than the Golf was, mostly because it's an automatic, the only thing I really miss is the auto-hold on the VW which meant I could take my foot off the brake and never have to engage the handbrake.

The Auto mode is a bit annoying. I always have it in Max eDrive or Sport. Or both! I'm still underwhelmed by the range...and because of the smaller petrol tank I now have range anxiety x2!

I too expected the car to feel faster. It doesn't seem as quick as my old Golf, and I'm not convinced the 'Boost' from the eDrive really does anything apart from use up battery. However!!! Driving an EV completely changes your driving behaviour. I imagined I'd be whistling past Audis at the lights in this, but instead I've become far more considered with when I use power and I'm far more motivated by generating 'free miles'. There's a theory, computer-gamism, that EVs give us the same rewards as video games. The car gives you small rewards and encourages you to drive in a certain way. It tells you when it is charging the battery, the range goes up the better you drive, and you instantly gain a couple of miles if you turn off the a/c. You plan your journey so you know when to use the EV or the ICE, sticking it in the right mode to reclaim those precious EV miles.

In short these sorts of hybrids are definitely an interim technology. Mine is 6 months into a 4 year lease, and I expect it will be pretty much obsolete by the end. By then, we will have a proper choice of EVs with bigger range and quicker charging and there won't be any need for the ICE bit at all.

Hi Neil
I think if you are looking for a ""premium"" feel or an EV with decent range, you are 100% looking at the wrong car ! That said, if you drove a 2017 MY car (build in 2016 probably) then you might not have the best reference point for the Mini ?

Don't forget that the Mini is BMWs ""Jr"" brand (a BMW lite) and they wont take market share from the i3(REx) by making the cheaper car, better than the more expensive i3 for anything - and Yes.... I know that a specced Mini can be over ¬£40K, but it is still the BMW Lite brand..... don't expect too much from the cheap plastic interior.... but also be aware that every car you sit in these days are cost-down specials (as an example, touch any of the trim on a current generation Merc that is not ""supposed to be touched in everyday life"" and tell me how good that feels !)

I got my Mini for two reasons.... 1) Tax fraud and 2) As a warm-up for the inevitable full EV that I will be forced into in a couple of company car rotations. 

My company flat out refused me an Audi E-Tron or an iPACE so I took the cheap option and went for the ""best"" PHEV I could get that came in under the ¬£40k band my company puts on tax related things. I tried the 330e and the GTE passat/golf previously and then had that rug pulled when they discontinued them through my CC provider, I also tried the C350e but really couldn't stand the fact that I couldn't fit anything in the boot (which was tiny)..... also didnt like the black paint of the Merc, which looked ""dark grey/blue"" under certain light conditions. 

I think the Mini represented the best ""bang for buck vs. Looks vs. quality compromise for under ¬£40K"" that I could find on the market at the moment... I guess towards the back end of this year you will be looking at a new VW and couple of new Audi and the first of the MHEV JLR stable to choose from, but stick with the Mini... give it chance, it will grow on you..... Besides, as a second car in the household the Mini isn't that bad !",0,0.0

Talking of Traction Control @Sean Davis ... Does yours intervene WAAAAAAAY early when you are driving in EV only mode ? Especially when you go over a bump / traffic calming / big undulation in the road for example ?

Thanks for reply. I think to get the full benefit of PHEV I would like to preheat car from the app as that sounds genuinely useful to me. Trouble is, the jump from a late 2017 model/early 2018 to one definetly built after March is massive (¬£3k -¬£5k). The model I drove was late 2017 and up for about ¬£28k.

I think the basic car P11D value on mine was about ¬£32K... throw in the paint, the wheels and few creature comforts and you are driving a ¬£38K car ! It makes me a bit sad when I think about how much E63 AMG I could be driving for ¬£38K !

Really I think the shift for company car drivers to PHEV (or pure EV) is purely tax based in the first instance right now, then care for the environment a distant second and company image somewhere a long way back... for the private driver, I don't think they make sense at all yet.... currently PHEV running costs vs. Diesel running costs are not in the same ball park.... I couldn't justify a private PHEV purchase right now, even as a second family car as the economics just aren't there yet. Maybe a full EV, but even then our second car gets driven on some 250 mile+ round trips to see family etc and my wife gets nervous when the fuel gauge gets near the 1/4 full mark so running on the final coulombs in an EV on a cold winters night with the heated rear screen on etc would be too stressful for her.

The ability to pre-condition the car is a nice gimmick i'll admit. Its saved me two ""scrapes"" this winter, both of which were really useful, although I could hire someone to do that for me for less than the ¬£3K you mention !",0,2577102.0

It must be you! Only joking. Actually, the opposite - in hybrid mode the traction control light comes on when I exit my company car park which has speed bumps - if I flick it to electric only, the traction control light does not come on; other than that, I rarely see the TC light flick on but I do drive in EV mode most of the time, especially on my work commute.

I wonder if tyres have got anything to do with it or just they have set up some cars differently - mines a March 18 model on Dunlop‚Äôs (never a fan of Bridgestones which some cars have - had them on my wife‚Äôs old Golf - they wear out quickly and have very poor grip). The Dunlop‚Äôs are ok on the CM so far (10000 miles in). 

But generally, having driven front wheel drive cars for many years until my rear-drive BMW company car I had before the CM, I stand by my comments that grip is far superior to FWD cars. The other thing to factor in is whether your tyres are run flats, mine are not - this could affect ride and handling.

The other thing to bear in mind, as mentioned before, is the extra 250kg of weight you are hoofing around versus non-hybrid cars.",1,2577094.0

Good points !

I can understand a few of the occasions ive seen the TCS light come on (wet / greasy roundabouts when im trying to maintain forward momentum etc) but the most noticeable for me is in EV only mode, coming out of a local village that has a series of speed humps on the UPHILL section..... Your comment about the extra weight of the EV gubbins, slung out over the back axle AND the big ass runflat Brigestones might be the No.1 cause of this !

Not noticeable in ICE mode, so I guess the whole ""going uphill, lots of weight out back, RWD'ing at the time and the shiny front tyres getting ""light"" on the bump-to-rebound element of the speed hump"" might just be the problem.",1,2577610.0

I have since seen the list of used cars on the MINI site and had a 48hr test drive this week. I have been looking at other alternatives, but the MINI is still the highest on my list.
I need a slightly higher car than a standard hatchback, my current car a SEAT Leon FR184 DSG I have looked at & test driven the Toyota RAV 4, too big really and has the horrible CVT gearbox, the C-HR is too dark & claustrophobic inside. Looked briefly at the Honda CRV and going for a test drive in a Lexus UX on Monday.
As I am retired BIK etc has no effect on me. I am keen on the PHEV, just need to convince myself the extra ¬£5K or so over a pure ICE car is worth while.
I do have some (silly?) questions.
Why is the standard 13A charging lead called a ‚Äúgranny lead‚Äù?
1- If the 13A cable charges at 13A & 3hr 15m and a 16A charges at 16A & 2hr 15m, how does the car identify which supply it is plugged into? 
2- What regulates the amount of current drawn into the car?
3- Can I use a type 2 lead and plug that into a Blue 16A socket ( MHU for my Motorhome ) in my garage and get a 16A charge?
4- are longer cables available and where from? I have a 13A socket just inside my garage, but the standard lead is just too short when I revers the car up to my garage. This maybe resolved if I could use item 3.
5- Are Charging cables usually supplied with a Wall charger?
6- Charging costs, am I correct in thinking the charging system will only draw electricity to charge the batteries back to 100%? ie say 50p to top up a battery at 50% & ¬£1 to fully charge a flat battery?
7- I have seen comments about turning off the AC to give more miles, does the ICE not power the AC?
Not necessarily PHEV questions
8- can a reversing camera be retrofitted & connected to the Centre display?
9- similarly front parking sensors?
One final thing, being a wee bit vertically challenged, I find the Centre armrest is too far back for my elbow to reach.
I am contemplating one of the used late 2018 cars with at least a Chili pack, a touch cheaper than new and without awaiting a new build. Apologies about all the questions, many thanks Gordon",0,0.0

Hi Gordon
I'm not expert on some of the ""mini specific"" bits, but I think these answers might help:-

1) The initial ""handshake"" between the car and the charger is all hardwired into the vehicle Battery Management System (BMS) and is controlled under the PEL69 and BS EN 15118 protocols - Cant remember the European standards, but I do know that ECE R100.02 has reference to the V2G handshake also. Effectively, via communication through one of the seven pins of the Type 2 connector the car ""Asks"" the charger what it is, the charger ""tells"" the car what it is and what is available and the two then decide what is what..... (sorry about the simplistic overview!) 
2) The vehicle BMS will determine what current (and voltage) the battery can accept depending on the battery SOC, cell health and a myriad of other factors. 
3) No idea ! Not knowing what your home charger looks like etc, I would suspect you might be able to get ""something"" out of it, but my Chargemaster home charger is a 30A unit and when I plugged into the standard household 240v mains supply with the supplied 3pin plug, it a) took ages to charge the car and b) everything got a bit too hot for my liking. I suspect if your garage charging socket is fused, you can just plug in a see what happens ?
4) check on eBay - I got a 5m cable from Mini for my car and have never struggled at any charging point. The charger on the car is on the LHF corner, so just reverse park / front park according to the position of the charging point
5) Chargemaster and Pod Point both offer tethered and untethered units. Pays your money - takes your choice
6) Depending on your home electricity supplier. I shopped around to find the best deal and USwitched. As I have E7 at my home, I set the car to charge overnight and pay around 9.9p/kW/h - day rate is about 20p/kW/h so the cost of charging will be dependent on the amount of charge and your consumer rate. Watch out for ""deals"" as OVO Energy are currently offering 2x years Polar Subscription which gives either FREE or very cheap charging at public charge points (Very useful !!)
7) Don't quote me on this one, but I believe the A/C compressor is both serpentine belt driven and clutched to run from the traction battery so you can have A/C in ICE or PHEV mode. If you are running in EV mode then the A/C will be driven off the traction battery and in ICE mode, driven from the S-Belt. Obviously any parasitic loading on the engine or the traction battery will result in lower fuel / energy consumption so once again, pays your money etc. I have seen bigger deltas in battery use through ambient temperature and / or driving style than from use of the A/C, but I dont live in the Arizona desert, so rarely use the A/C these days unless its very warm !
8 & 9) Almost certainly NOT. I presume you could fit some cheap and cheerful aftermarket system, but it will be a dogs dinner of an install and you will never be able to integrate any aftermarket system into a modern vehicle CAN system. I think you can get a reversing camera and the front parking sensors as one of the many ""packs"" on Countryman, but I wouldn't even attempt to fit aftermarket equipment to a modern car",0,2596738.0

Hi Gordon, I have one of these cars so let me explain.

But first, you can only make an economic case for these cars (and even then a not very strong one) if you drive in a certain way. The kerb weight difference between the PHEV and a normal countryman s diesel is 350kg. That's like carrying an extra 4 adults around all the time. It makes a big difference to the ICE fuel economy. So if you are doing long distance commuting, say over 20 miles each way, and longer one off trips of say 200, 300 miles, then this car won't make sense either economically or environmentally because you will actually burn more fuel than the ICE equivalent. I also have a Qashqai 1.6dci which I can get 62mpg from on a long motorway run, the best I got from the mini phev was around 45mpg on long runs. On the other hand, if you are just pootling around your local area and you have a 16A charger at home so you can recharge overnight and also whilst parked on driveway then it can make more sense as you could then drive it on 100% electric. It sounds to me like you are in the latter category?

A granny lead is the oldest, lowest level technology which gives the slowest charge, plugging into a normal 13A wall plug. Although on the Mini PHEV you only really have 2 options, either the 13A granny lead which comes with the car or a 16A cable, which you can set up at home with a home charging unit. I have tethered because it makes life much easier, one less end to plug in. We recharge minimum of once a day (overnight), at weekends three times a day, and no way would my wife plug it in if she had to do plug in both ends.

1. You just change a setting in the car. So better to stick to one, don't swap 13 to 16 to 13 as you will keep having to change setting
2. A setting in the car does this, charging setting high or low, but if you are using 16A and set it to low don't worry, it will just be slower to charge but won't damage car
3. I believe so
4. Yes they are, from the home charging installer (see below). But do not use an extension cable, this will void your warranty, cause you trouble on your home insurance if there is a fire, etc, after spending ¬£30k on a car spend ¬£800 to sort out your home charging situation properly. Get an external 16A box attached to wall with longer, tethered cable, should cost ¬£250-300 after incentives
5. Yes, but you need to choose tethered (one end connected to home charger and one end loose to plug into car) or untethered (cable loose and can be put into back of car). Depends on your driving pattern. But in 2 years I have only ever charged at home, I have NEVER charged at roadside or destination chargers, too much hassle for the tiny amount of charge you get. Some people do for the better parking spaces available, its kind of like cheating by parking in a disability bay when there is nothing wrong with you and other really disabled people have nowhere to park!
6. Correct
7. When driving on electric, turn off AC. And heater. It makes BIG difference to electric miles achievable. Or don't turn off and just have it flip over to the ICE engine sooner.
8. I had a reverse parking sensor in my pack, I guess that is the optional tech pack. Camera is very clear.
9. Don't know, I guess available in one of BMWs myriad options
10. Centre armrests are an optional extra so double check any car you buy has one! Assume nothing with these cars! As far as I know none of them have electrically powered seats, for example.

I would say think hard about whether or not your driving requirements match the technical capabilities of this car. ¬£30k is a lot to pay for a car to pootle around town. I bought a ¬£4,000 Skoda Citigo for my daughter and I tend to drive that now because living around London it is so much easier to squeeze through gaps and into spaces, and far less expensive consequences!",0,0.0

First of all, my wife has mobility problems and struggles to get into and out of my Leon , which is the main reason I‚Äôm looking for something taller. We have looked at other vehicles and the Countryman looks the best bet. I would love a PHEV Ateca or Karoq but they are not available yet.
I fancy a hybrid, just to make my contribution to emissions. Journeys are normally reasonably short to the shops & back, 5-10 mile so easily achieved on battery only. Once or twice a week, a 15 mile trip to my Mother in Law‚Äôs, the round trip being around 50 miles, which will obviously need the ICE. Around twice a year in my duties as a Chief Timekeeper on Rallies on Otterburn Ranges, I would easily do around 150 at a swift pace, where ICE & EV mode together would be very nice. I could recharge from a generator but doubtful that I would get anymore than an hour each time, which may put a little back into the battery.
I am installing a new dedicated socket in my garage which I intend to use for charging. I‚Äôm not convinced yet that a Charging (pod) point is necessary for the MINI, I would be happy enough with a 16amp supply, the socket I‚Äôm fitting will be on 6mm cable. I would happily install a blue 16amp socket but I don‚Äôt think there is any way the car will ‚Äúknow‚Äù‚Äù the supply is capable of providing 16amps.

On a ‚Äúproper dedicated‚Äù pod type charger, the 7 pin plug/socket communicates with the car to tell it to draw power at the higher rate. If I have not got this right in my head please advise me.

Hi Karen
I had the same problems when I first got my MINI! A few months back I smugly parked up at the Eden Project next to the charging point, opened the boot to get the cable and discovered...there was no cable!

Firstly, if you want to use public chargers that don't have tethered cables, you'll need to purchase a public charging cable from MINI. I think they're about ¬£165 - why they don't come as standard is beyond me, other than the obvious extra cash they can extract.

Secondly, when you use the Ecotricity chargers, make sure you've set up the charge on the App before plugging in and try locking the car. I'm not sure locking is necessary but it did the trick for me when I kept getting errors. I think the adapter can slip slightly out of alignment sometimes as the cables are really heavy. One plus with Ecotricity is that the WiFi seems to go down quite frequently and you get a free charge!

Glad you got it working! I don't think you have to lock it, but I found it helped when getting errors. I think if you unlock while charging it might interrupt it though.

Charging time is 3hr15mins off the mains and 2hr15mins with a wall charger. If you go for the untethered charger, you should get a public charging cable with it, but you will have to retrieve it and plug both ends in every time you charge at home. I went for a tethered charger and can definitely recommend that, it takes a few secs to plug in. I don't think I could be bothered faffing around with leads if it was hissing down with rain.

To take advantage of (most) untethered - no lead - public charging cables, you will need a ""public charging cable"" from Mini - or ebay if you dont mind risking the whole ""invalidating your warranty if it all goes pear shaped"" scenario. 

As the car is a PHEV, it can only accept 3.5kW charging, irrespective of the output of the charging post - the car will determine what it will accept, all you need to worry about is changing the setting in the main menu on the car for charging immediately vs. Charging at a later time to take advantage of the E7/E10 overnight cheap rate electricity. 

You can also do this on the MiniConnected App.

I had problems with this the first time I downloaded the App, but RESET FACTORY settings on the car and a hard reboot of my iPhone solved all the problems and it works perfectly on all charging points - either my home charger or public charging points.

Be aware that the motorway service (Elec-trocity - like ATTROCITY) chargers are notoriously unreliable and i'd always assume its the charger NOT the car in the first instance of an issue. You have obviously paid upwards of ¬£32,000 (or your company has) for the car, so the ¬£165 for a cable is the price of a meal out or a half decent shirt, so just get the official cable from Mini, join the Polar Network (¬£8 a month) and download ZAPMAP and you will be fine charging in public.... its cheap too at around 10p/k/Wh so destination charging is as good as charging overnight at home.... I find myself choosing destinations now, based on ZAPMAP so I can get a cheap charge and save money for the return journey.... have fun !",0,0.0

All it actually means is that the car will use brakes or regen to hold it going down hill or if you reduce the set speed. Most modern cruise controls do this anyway.

Adaptive cruise control uses a camera or better still a radar and a camera to slow the car when it detects a vehicle or anything else in front. Typically you can set the separation distance somewhere in a menu, some systems allow the car to stop and start in traffic jams by itself. More importantly it is usually linked to active emergency braking which will prevent most rear end collisions and may also apply the brakes for pedestians and cyclists.",0,0.0

When my wife & I test drove it 2 weeks ago, we both felt car sick!. Not a good sign. We were given a Level 3 with the 17"" wheels. Otherwise a really good car with 180bhp although through the front wheels are prone to a little torque steer most of the time when you push the ""loud""  pedal. Would probably like to try it with the 16"" wheels as we both it found it touch too firm and ""jiggly"". Also it was a shame the Level 3,although really well optioned as standard, was unremittingly dark inside. Black leather and black head lining etc made it feel claustrophobic, even with the double sunroof. I was under the impression, because it was MINI, you can chop and change, with options (ie-have the Level 2 seats for example) but not sure you can do that with the E. Dealer was busy with another customer on return so never got to ask him (and no follow up call from them either. Must be selling well!)

Finally we just couldn't justify the cost versus keeping the PHEV a bit longer.

Hi Jon, welcome to the club! The range, like all EVs, will vary depending on previous journeys. Most importantly, the weather plays a BIG part. In the winter, range suffers badly because you've got lights, heating, wipers on and the battery and motor need to be warm to work efficiently. You can eek out a bit more by making sure you pre-condition the battery, which you should definitely do as there is nothing like jumping straight into your warm and toasty car flicking the Vs at your neighbours scraping their windscreens ?. The good news is that the range will improve when the weather warms up. Use in green mode around town and you can glide around without denting the range cursing other drivers who keep hitting the brakes for no reason. I've rarely got past 20 miles though...",0,0.0

I've had my MINI for just over a year and I'm still talking about the tech with anyone who shows an interest! It took me a while to figure it all out, I don't think the switches and controls are as intuitive as they could be. Plus my MINI likes to randomly change whatever is on the central display every time I start it up...the updated CarPlay seems to have helped this though. There are plenty of quirks to discover, I think I read somewhere that the battery doesn't recharge if it's more than 80% full so if you're looking to max out the neutrons it's probably best to start in Green mode. I might have made that up though.

I find the engine braking to be quite aggressive in Sport mode, I rarely need to use the brakes. The Tesla must be even more harsh, I haven't driven one so can't compare.",0,2756867.0

When I turn climatisation on I would have expected to see some prompt to select a temperature in the cabin. Or does it use the last used setting from the dash ? Ie if I had the car at 18 degrees when get out at the end of the day, and then set climatisation on for the morning, will it aim to heat the cabin to 18. The reason I ask is that in the summer you might want to pre-cool the car.

Sorry - Worked for an American OEM for many years, but everyone I know at a manufacturer level here in the UK refers to a ""MIL""... Basically any warning light triggered by a parameter outside of operating norms.

Certainly the Countryman will have a winter tyre option available from the dealers for the countries where it is needed, but that will not likely have been part of the base vehicle homologation, as that tyre would have to then be included as part of the worse-casing process and would affect coastdown times and therefore the CO2 on the emissions test with a knock on to the VED (here in the UK its the VED, but whatever scheme exists in the rest of the world/Europe) - the Mini ""recommended"" Winter tyres will likely be part of a dealer fit option pack and therefore outside the scope of Type Approval, but totally within C&U rules. You will probably have to use the standard rims (and TPMS monitoring system) and get the dealer to fit your winter tyres to your exisiting rims - and then have them run the scan tool, just to say ""its OK"".... ? Would be interested to know how this would work with a 2019 (and beyond) MY car that could be used for ISM of the RDE / PEMS emissions test.... The car would probably have to be reverted back to its ""summer"" tyres as these were what it was homologated on ?

I dont think any OEM offers steel rims as part of an options pack for the UK ? And certainly I dont recall seeing many 'modern' cars running an alternative steel rim in the winter (unless they were made with them and the wheel trims have fallen off - some base model Vauxhall still have steel rims with wheel trims). Modern aluminium alloy wheels are so much better protected than steel for UK road use (salt + water & grit) and even ""performance"" tyres these days have superb water displacement properties so no advantages / disadvantages anymore. 

For the 2 or 3 days a year that we get enough snow to bother the standard cars setup is it really worth the hassle of winter tyres ? Especially as the cars ESP / ASP system will intervene whatever the tyre you are running - even when switched ""off"" if the road conditions are that bad ?",0,2710267.0

Hi @freddym - you need to disassociate the dealers where you buy the cars from with the actual OEMs who make the cars from a ""Type Approval"" or ""Homologation"" perspective. The dealers might be officially franchised for a particular brand, but they are not the OEM itself (if that makes sense?). You can't go to Cowley and buy your Mini directly from the end of the production line - or from NedCar in Eindhoven if you are talking the Mini PHEV - You buy it from a dealership. 

The OEM is responsible for the vehicle upto and including the issue of the CoC (so upto the point of first registration when it is transferred to the dealer) and then not a lot else thereafter unless it is a warranty or recall issue, so all dealers offer consumers things POST REGISTRATION, that would not be part of the OEMs intended Whole Vehicle (WVTA) approval for the car (like bike racks, or alternative wheels as obvious examples of things that the OEM would not want included in the WVTA) - obviously these things would have been signed off for sale by the OEM in their name - for safety, quality and durability etc - but they would not form part of the WVTA. 

The ""homologated"" winter tyres you can buy from your dealership (anywhere in the EU28) must have the E mark on them... its a mandatory requirement for any tyre for road use in Europe to have that E mark on to prove it has met the requirements of ECE Regulation 117. Regulation 117 (including the 3PMSF symbol if its designed for ""winter use"") is a stand alone test of noise, rolling resistance and wet grip on the tyre, not a test of the vehicle. Wheels themselves are not a separate type approved item and therefore dont need an E mark - they will be rigorously tested by the manufacturer, but these tests are not ""Type Approval"". 

Mini (in this case) will offer a range of tyre sizes / widths and brands as part of their WVTA, but all of these offered as ""standard fitment"" must be capable of achieving the officially published Type Approval test results or each and every subject in WVTA and this may not be the full range of wheel and tyre options that your local dealer will be able to offer you. So what you can buy from your local dealership (steel wheel and 3PMSF M+S tyres) is not technically ""homologated"" for the car, just ""homolgated"" as a separate technical unit for sale on any car they will fit. 

The debate on if you 'need' winter tyres is a different matter and I totally understand that reversing up a 1:4 slope in 3 feet of snow in the Shetland islands is a totally different proposition to driving on a dusting of fine powder in Central London.",0,2710640.0

I get what you are saying and have also noticed the more ""random than really necessary"" switch to ICE whilst in Max E Drive, im 8 months and 15,000 miles in now, so have had a few occurrences myself. 

Mine usually switches back to Max E when I manually flick the drive select switch up and have never had to do a key on restart to force that change.... that either sounds like a fault, or whatever triggered the Max E Drive to switch off in the first instance is still ""visible"" to the drivesystem when you are trying to switch back. 

The concept of the ""kick down"" is as much to do with the speed of throttle position change as it is to do with pure throttle position - try it on a quiet stretch of road, you can go vvvveeeerrrrryyyyy sssslllllooooowwwwwlllllyyyy to (nearly) WOT without the ICE intervention, but you can also get the ICE to kick in with a very small amount of throttle position change if you stab the pedal very quickly. 

Also things like gradient, battery SOC and parasitic loading (A/C, heated seats, wipers and headlights) etc will all have a large affect on battery demand and depending on the ""perfect storm"" of conditions the car might see enough threshold parameters to trigger the ICE even though you as the driver are now expecting or needing that.

Please don't misquote (or misread) @freddym 

I said ""very hard braking from high speed (e.g. Coming into a roundabout on a dual carriageway)"" not ""very high speed braking"" - different use cases and different connotations

Very hard braking = Pushing the pedal with a lot more effort than under normal driving conditions
High speed = 70mph on a dual carriageway

Very High Speed Braking = Braking from a very high speed

Maybe its the old racing driver in me, but when its a case of getting stuck behind a line of much slower traffic on the long single carriageway section after a dualled part, or being the last of the late brakers on the way into the roundabout, i'm the one making up time under braking rather than trying the death or glory overtakes into oncoming traffic that the rest of the users of the A421 seem to do...

I've been driving since I was 15 years old and i can tell the decel rate vs. pedal actuation of any vehicle pretty much within the first press of the pedal - its easy, you just calibrate what your foot and head are telling you ! 
In my lifetime (and given my professional career) I have been lucky enough to have driven everything from standard road cars, to 1000bhp Hyper cars, through to vans, emergency service vehicles, HD vehicles, buses and military trucks. 
Every vehicle has an ""Amount of push = an amount of decel"" - and everyone is different.... The Mini just has this weirdly disconnected non-linear feeling that differs depending on speed and driving mode - I felt it first when I drove the first Hybrid London buses, but they were running EV regen + foundation brakes + retarders. The Mini is different to any other vehicle (PHEV or not) that I have ever drive - Thats why I commented. 

It does make me wonder with some people though that they have never felt ABS actuation before.... it should be a mandatory requirement for every driver to perform a maximum rate decel once in their lives.

I totally agree that everyone should find out what an emergency stop feels like in their new car (not just once in a lifetime).

Before the days of ABS it was even more important since you had to deal with getting the maximum braking right and handling often got very exciting too. Now all that's sorted for you.

The Mini is pretty portly, but I dont think its a mass issue. The front rotors are huge and the back discs are ventilated (never seen that on a production car under ¬£100K before).

The Leon had 312mm rotors on the front and the standard pad material was VERY good and fade free. On many of my ‚Äúhooligan drives‚Äù (off the public highway) the discs were frequently a cherry red colour and the brakes still hadn‚Äôt faded! I know this is extreme use. 
When I first tried the MINI brakes in anger, with ABS kicking in, I was surprised and disappointed to see the distance the car travelled whilst attempting to stop! 
Only this last weekend, I was on a gravel downhill road, when I attempted to slow down the ABS was constantly kicking in, so much so I thought I was going to go off as I could not get the speed down! I suspect the ABS is cutting in far too soon, but how do I broatch this at the dealers?!?
One other point, as it is the ABS that appears to be the issue, I cannot see changing pad material will make any difference.
One great thing is the pace with both engines and 225bhp!!!! One of the primary reasons for buying the MINI!",0,2677535.0

A man after my own heart sir !

Pad material will barely affect the ABS actuation point that you would notice anyway - plus MINI will not be able to do anything other than supply the R13H type approved pads and certainly wont be able to recal your ABS. Totally against Type Approval rules dont you know !

You could buy aftermarket pads yourself and risk a) invalidating your warranty or b) destroying the pedal feel further, but if I were you i'd suffer in silence like me (tsk !!!) - or ask inane questions about in on nerd sites.... Either way we are stuck with it for two and a half more years.... !!!

My company is Paris based and all my fellow Directors 'en France all drive PSA product.... Apparently in 2020 we are due to get a load of Peugeot PHEV products in the UK and having driven the 3008 on one of our proving grounds I can testify to how bloody awesome it was - nearly 300bhp (combined) and driveability as sweet as you liked and the brakes felt like they were carbon-carbon.....

One way to test that theory is to return to that same gravel downhill stretch. Disengage ABS and then drive and brake at the same rates as before - but use your hooligan experience to cadence brake in the old fashioned way ( As we all had to do back in the day ).

That should eliminate any ABS weirdness and also prove whether the brakes are really up to it or not. Such a downhill gravel surface would be the ultimate test and if they work there they should work anywhere.

Unfortunately ""disconnecting"" the ABS of a modern car would trigger so many errors its highly likely that the car wouldn't actually function at all, let alone allow you that sort of experimentation. 

I think the early ABS intervention is just systemic of the car / model / weight distribution / ABS sensitivity calibration by BMW Mini and something you will just have to learn to drive around like any other foibles of the car. Its pretty much the only thing that makes modern driving fun.... trying to get around the electronic interventions.

Its nice to hear that there are still some people who like to drive cars in the world - and who care enough about what they are feeling to question if things could be better. All modern OEMs have to cater for Mr/Mrs Everyday - from all corners of the globe - with their current products. The cost-down generation of making as few variants for as many markets as possible, for the lowest common denominator driver means that the only way to get ""exciting"" driving is to turn to one of the premium brands ""Special Operations"" models (BMW M, AMG, FR, John Cooper Works etc etc) for a slightly more driver focused experience. 

Maybe a John Cooper Works - 'Red Hot Dutch' Pack (or whatever Mini call that sort of thing) for the 2020MY Countryman PHEV might be the answer to our prayers ?",0,2677825.0

Name: Unnamed: 0, dtype: int64",72850,"Aug 3, 2019","One or two things:

1 Gravel and ABS are very poor bedfellows. I spend a lot of time on forest tracks at work and most modern cars/SUVs are a disaster as on loose surfaces you need to skid the wheels a bit to stop in a hurry (build up a wedge of stone in front of the wheels, same as with fresh snow). On Land Rover forums you often get calls for an ABS override switch for people who actually use their 4x4s off road for this reason.

2. I drive the mechanically identical 225xe and get what you are talking about. The issue comes from the hybrid system which tries to use the initial pedal travel for electrical re-generation only without friction brakes. Remember re-gen is off the back axle so the initial few mm of pedal travel gives you rear wheel electrical braking, then the friction brakes come into play when you press harder. This robs the pedal of that initial feel you are looking for. The brakes themselves are powerful enough but take a little more time to dial in because of the not-so- linear nature of the braking. Gives you some interesting potential for attitude adjustment if you are a left foot braker! But if you are accustomed to brakes with good feel it may take some getting used to or you may never come to like it. I replaced a Prius so I was used to this type of system and the 225 is waaaay better.

3. The mini is 1.7 tonnes dry, 'you canna change the laws of physics, Jim'. It comes with tyres optimised for economy, not outright grip, It might go like a hot hatch but it is never going to stop like one.",1,0.0

But you have a bladder busting REX don't you. That range is far too little for a one car familly. I know I have been there. Fine for a small daily commute but little else.

Yes. But some do charge at higher rates. Tesla charge the 75 kWh battery at 250 kW because they have better up to date technology. If it was like for like the ""new"" mini would charge at something like 125 kW. As it is it's a ""city car"" and would be pretty slow going on longer trips of over 100 miles.

No. 6 - press the button firmly once, then release, then press it again - by the time you get to the petrol flap you should have heard a pfff of air being released and the flap should open. 

Not sure about No. 4 - the only thing that comes on when I get in the car is Apple Music.

No. 2 - yes!

No. 1 - no! Maybe you have hands like Pat Jennings. If you don‚Äôt know who he is, he was a brilliant goalkeeper, with hands like shovels. 

No. 3 - how do you know the heated mirrors are on? I have no indication mine are on, just that it takes 5 minutes or so for any dew to disappear - not noticed any ‚Äòhaze‚Äô.

No. 5 - it is quite a loud, tinny noise when shutting the boot but I have noticed that the boot can be shut with quite a gentle shove - it is easy to slam it down, particularly if you are in a hurry, or if you are like my wife, who slams doors hard just for the fun of it - I swear one of them will drop off one day.

No. 7 - no issues with any of the doors.

No. 8 - my bratlings are too old for car seats now (actually, they have been for at least 10 years, so I could have just said, n/a).

The petrol flap button doesn‚Äôt open the flap - because it is a pressurised system, the first push of the button releases any air and the second one releases the lock, you then manually push the flap to open.

I am not entirely sure why hybrid cars need this vapour release prior to opening the flap, as all petrol tanks create pressure, other than I am guessing it is an extra safety measure due to the electric gubbings potentially causing further risk for a fire.

I have the armrest and yes, there is the old style USB port underneath it in a cubby, so 2 in total - I agree though, bloody cheek to charge extra! I can understand charging extra for the wireless charging pad in the upper part, but surely they could do one with and one without? 

You can configure the door settings easily enough as ByeByeTDI said. 

I think starting off in Auto mode makes sense to me - this is the setting that, if the car is fully charged, optimises range and economy. 

I have tried Green mode a couple of times and any, marginal, benefit in fuel economy is outweighed by just how slow it feels - mostly Auto for me, and when I am feeling a bit fruity, flick on the old Sport button and away you go.",0,2445762.0

I‚Äôm a bit confused about the size of the fuel tank. Looking on the Configutator on the Mini website there is an Activity Pack (¬£800) which contains the following:
‚Ä¢ 61 litre fuel tank - 10 litres larger than standard.
‚Ä¢ Automatic Tailgate.
‚Ä¢ Luggage compartment separating net.
‚Ä¢ Rear sliding seats.
‚Ä¢ Rear Picnic Bench for the boot ledge.

So if the 61 litre fuel tank is 10 litres larger than standard then that suggests the standard tank is 51 litres........which is much bigger than I previously thought?",1,0.0

The standard fuel tank is indeed 51 litres but the PHEV is 36 litres. I've been seeing a lot more of my local petrol station than I'd like .

I've had a look at the new line-up and it's not that much different really, and there's really not much difference between the 3 trims, mostly cosmetic extras. The Tech pack has gone so if I had to order again, I'd find it very hard to stump up ¬£600 for the Harman Kardon sound system, which is awesome btw. The Chili pack was included in the base price when I ordered so work paid for most of it, which meant I had some scope for extras. I couldn't spec all the options I got without doubling my contribution now. They really add up now...¬£200 for the sport button (MINI Driving Modes), ¬£1100 for LED headlights (HALOGEN AS STANDARD!?!), ¬£125 for fogs...

Really can't fathom how neither the Comfort pack nor Comfort Plus pack include Comfort Access or Auto tailgate

The horn has to reach a certain peak decibel level to comply with ECE Regulation 28 (Audible Warning Devices).

Great news on the software fix - I hadn't really noticed until it was pointed out on the forum (although i'm an ardent Radio 4 listener, so not much call for song titles !)

I have been doing some ""man maths"" on my car (after 4x months of ownership vs. my old Diesel company wagon) and the saving in BIK tax over that 4x month period DOES just about cover the additional cost of the fuel (at todays prices only) + electric I have used in the car over the Diesel I would have used. 

In no way could I justify a PHEV as a private purchase though ! Just doesn't make any economic sense at all !

No one has had one long enough, or enough of them floating around on the second hand market to see what residuals are like either.

I think my real concern with 2nd hand ownership of a PHEV (or an EV for that matter) is based on the fact that I don't think anyone (other than the OE dealerships) would ever be able to do any repairs to the car if it went wrong in later life. 

On a conventional ICE car, even one under 5 years old, most independent garages can ""have a go"" at repairs and maintenance. I have always done all repairs myself - including a clutch change on a 2011 MY Zafira B last Saturday !!, but I am concerned who could help out with the replacement (or even diagnostic in the first place) of say - a BMS problem on a PHEV / EV or help me with advice on how to change the invertor, or the eMotor or any of the other ""magic"" on a non-ICE vehicle ? 

And the cost on the second hand market of a battery pack ? and the risk of death by electrocution ?

True. In fact, the whole repair and servicing ecosystem will have to undergo a huge change as existing repair chains simply cannot do anything to help, and as you say the threshold at which people will have to decide whether to repair or write off will be far higher than today. Maybe now you can tinker around on a ¬£1,000 - 2,000 value petrol car and get it back on the road, but nobody can tinker with an electric car, hence maybe the write-off limit is more like ¬£6,000 - 10,000. If more of the repair work has to go back to the OEMs, at their extravagant rates, then that will push the write-off limit up again. Having Mini get the job done in Austria is obviously an entirely different magnitude of cost compared to having Andy at the end of the road take a look, or even Halfords.",1,2619288.0

Unfortunately true mass adoption of EV (because, bare in mind that HEV is only a 'bridging technology') will have to mean some pretty big compromise and wallet searching for all adopters.

To be honest, hitting the ton was probably doable, but I rolled into our Hove office after 65 miles from Bexleyheath on whatever the E-quivalent of fumes was, one winter's day with no heating on. 2.2 mi/kWh indicated IIRC

85 was easy - the trouble with the thing, and this afflicted all of them (we had 30 at one point), was that the SoC clock (Ye Olde needle based affair) dropped like a stone to 20% and then stayed there for 20 miles. One alway wondered how close to empty it really was, and so going into sub-20s was a white-knuckler. Might have been fine though.

Amazing vehicle - not least because it didn't have Mode 3 charging and so using a live cable to charge it meant de-energise, connect, re-energise to avoid arcing. No-one in the U.K. ever charged one at 50A, to our knowledge. You had to manually select in the input amperage.

So you drive around 16,000 miles a year just on school runs? Wow!

I do 16k per year on average which includes a 44 mile daily commute on work days.

And if it‚Äôs multiple journeys around home, you can plug in whilst stopped of course so immaterial really.

Most vehicles don‚Äôt get anywhere near that annual mileage and if it‚Äôs a second car, it doesn‚Äôt have to cope with long ranges as it could be swapped and even if it couldn‚Äôt be swapped, there‚Äôs always charging as the last resort.

My son is more typical in terms of use. He drives the Leaf most of the time, 8k miles per year, hardly ever has to charge on the public network. Lower his car‚Äôs range to 60 miles and it would not significantly change that.",1,1570889.0

I agree not a great article (I thought we'd moved on from ""gallery"" style articles too... sigh) but this is the most information I think that has come out about this car so far even if it's minimal.

It does say it is based on the existing platform, that was not designed to be an EV. The batteries are in mostly in the transmission tunnel (hmm... I guess they mean exhaust etc tunnel ) and under the back seats.

I was intrigued by this car, perhaps if it had come out 3+ years ago it would be more appealing. At this point it is going to look extremely unappealing especially as it will presumably be priced as they guesstimate, ¬£25k+ for a 100mi range approx.

I agree with you on the point about the use of statistics and words. 

What I take offence at is that the points are being made in support of eMobility as a whole and are currently not representative of reality nor are ethically painting a correct picture. 

The ""2.5 million cars are used for under 40 miles a day"" statistic is ignoring the fact that the other 30+ million cars on the roads in the UK today probably do drive more that 40 miles per day (presumably - but I wonder where the base statistic is derived from anyway as no census exists as far as I can tell that asks every driver or registered car owner in the UK for the distance driven per car / per day - nor does the ability to collate over the air post drive data from every car in the UK).

Its the same with the ""average charging session is 20 minutes long"" statement from Electrocity (meaning that as this is an average, some people charge for much less than 20 minutes and some for much longer - its an average, not an absolute). This gives the impression to the lay person that 20 minutes is all you need for charging an EV.

Its the same use of rhetoric that makes us all feel good about eating that chocolate bar that is ""95% fat free...."" which is another way of saying that 5% of what you have just eaten is full of fat.

By all means, be skeptical of how companies and policy makers use statistics. Dig deep into the methodology and how the data were derived, look at the statistic in the wider context, look at what analysis is done and whether this was appropriate, think about what the statistic actually tells you and whether this aligns with the conclusions being drawn, etc etc.

There is an exceptionally good episode of More Or Less that looks at what questions should be asked when thinking about the statistics being claimed in a headline or article.

More or Less - Debunking guide ‚Äì on a postcard - [object Object] - BBC Sounds

My point was merely that I disagree with the premise of the phrase, as it seems to suggest that statistics are always unreliable, and the fault is with the method of statistics. IMO it just absolves responsibility from the people misinterpreting the statistic to push an agenda, whether maliciously or through ignorance....possible naively, but I think the latter more often.... Many concepts in statistics are hard to grasp.

I'll be happy to look into the two statistics in more detail, however I am struggling to find the origin of them?

With regards to the 2.5million only travel 40miles, the closest I have come is the 2016 National Travel Survey that on page 21 looks at the average journey per trip and indicates it has reduced from around 100mi in 2002, to about 90mi in 2016. This of course has a very different interpretation to the statistic above. This data is primarily based on weekly journey diary's, and is on around 450,000 responses.

https://assets.publishing.service.g...a/file/633077/national-travel-survey-2016.pdf

So without the original source for the claim, it's hard to critique!

Likewise the only detail on the Ecotricity one is this article, which suggests it was merely used as a means of structuring their payment method (charges are based on 20mins blocks).

Charging for charging: UK EV drivers to lose free power privileges

Again, without the original source of the claim, it's hard to know whether the criticism you level towards it is justified.

Yes, the average is just a central tendency point of the distribution. There will be values higher and lower than it, but if we assume a normal distribution (which really needs to be assumed for the mean to be an appropriate summary statistic), then the more you move away from the mean, the rarer this will be. I have always advocated for measures of variance to be included with any mean estimate to give the reader a sense of how varied the data was around this mean estimate. Personally I prefer a standard deviation, but appreciate many audience members will be unfamiliar with how to interpret this! Perhaps 95% confidence intervals, but then again that is even more abstract a concept to grasp!",1,2559362.0

Its a really difficult one to call. No idea where the statics originated, but looking at the availability of data, potentially the number of registered cars on the road in the UK divided by the total distance driven per annum of all the cars from the MOT database ? Who knows ?

By Friday evening after I have visited the office (a 300 mile round trip) my car will have done on average 62.4 miles.

Pre-Conditioning as many PHEV and all BEV's have, heats the car on the mains whilst plugged in and apart from never having to scrape the ice off, a warm car to set off in is very nice. If the journey is short enough then there is no need to turn on the heating.

When you say JCW pack, I assume you mean JCW Chili pack? And you are right, it is all very confusing and you pick a pack then realise, like I did also, that folding mirrors was not included! I ordered mine with the JCW Chili pack and the Tech pack but I think the Tech pack has now changed and folding mirrors are included - Byebyetdi knows more about this, I think!

When I ordered mine, most reviews said you should have at least the Chili pack to get certain goodies, and I wanted the Tech pack as well so I could have the HK sound system, HUD and bigger media screen.

The JCW bit adds a nice steering wheel, different, two-tone wheels and a different rear spoiler (although I find it hard to spot the difference with the standard spoiler) - I really like the JCW bits I have to say, but the black spoke wheels also look good.

The packs, as is understandable, are better value versus ordering the parts individually but you may not want the HK system, but really want the HUD, for example, so just add that.

As long as your car has not reached the production stage, it is ‚Äòamendable‚Äô so you can make any number of changes if allowed / wanted.

The lounge leather looks good and is a nice addition but the standard cloth / leather combo and hazy dash and doors are also very nice and the interior looks and feels upmarket versus other, similar cars.

I can‚Äôt remember now if the reversing camera was standard or part of the Tech pack, but I find it incredibly useful and along with the HUD would be in the list of ‚Äòmust-haves‚Äô for my next car in three and a half years‚Äô time!

There are 2 JCW options: the JCW Chili Pack which gets you pretty much everything, and the JCW Sports Pack which just adds the nice sporty looking kit. 

Sean is correct, the Chili pack now includes the folding mirrors. The Tech pack now gives you the HUD, HK Sound, and the reversing camera. To get the bigger screen you now have to also add the Nav+ pack which is ¬£1300 and basically just gives you a bigger screen - I couldn't justify this!!!

If it is just red stitching and a little JCW badge that is the difference, then probably not - I can‚Äôt remember the wheel on the test car I drove, which was non-JCW.

I think it would be clearer if they changed the names of the packs. The JCW Sports Pack is basically ""non-chili"". Keeping the Tech pack but changing what it includes is a little misleading! As far as I could work out the Nav+ pack gives you a bigger screen a ""concierge service"" whatever that means, and the centre armrest storage which comes with the Chili pack anyway.

I still have a very small window to change my spec (probably a couple of days!) so I'll resist the JCW steering wheel unless someone tells me it's amazing. I've got someone from Fleet looking into why the Lapis Blue and Sun Protection Glass are against company policy, but I'm starting to favour the Island Blue now anyway, and I can always get the windows tinted after delivery.

As per my initial question, I'm intrigued to find out if the electronic boot opening is included in the Comfort Access pack now. Everything suggests it is, but I assume you don't have it on your pre-update model?",1,2346850.0

I'm hoping the HUD is good as I really like how the VW's give you the next nav instruction on the dash MFD, including a countdown to the next turn.

No, electric boot opening was another cost-option and although nice to have, I thought I could cope without it especially as height is not an issue for me and it is not clear if it is now in the pack.

The Lapis blue is, what, about ¬£300 more than the metallics, so maybe that is an issue? Not sure why, if you can order extras, why you couldn‚Äôt order that colour or the sun protection glass, though? 

I looked at the configurator last night and the price difference to get my spec is about ¬£1300 more - the only real difference I can see is the concierge service which was an extra on my model - I think you can call them up and ask for directions to be put in your sat nav amongst other things!",0,2346902.0

The nav directions are fairly basic as in it shows you arrows for direction, roundabouts with the exit arrowed and how many yards to your next turn but it works well for me - on the Nav screen you can split the view so on the right hand side of the screen you can vary the view and one very useful one is as you describe where it sets out the subsequent turns and if you want to see what is coming up you can use the scroller knob to do this.

The VW digital dash does look amazing although I didn‚Äôt use it with the nav directions on when I test drive the GTE. 

On the MINI, the bigger screen does fill the gap a bit better and for the split view screen you obviously get a slightly bigger map view / direction view or music / map views or whichever way you configure it. 

JoJo might be able to confirm what the sat nav directions look like on her (sorry Jo, I am assuming you are a ‚Äòshe‚Äô - huge apologies, if not) HUD as she has the driver assistance pack which enhances the HUD with more colours and speed sign recognition and also has a pedestrian warning system.",0,2346918.0

Mine has an aluminium foot rest, not sure about the pedals unless I look (not been able to drive fir the last 3 weeks).

As mine is a lease car I won‚Äôt be making any mods - I have bought a genuine MINI boot mat, which looks quite smart - it was ¬£55 when I first got my car, so I didn‚Äôt bother, then they dropped the price to ¬£45, inc free delivery, so I went for it. So if that comes in at ¬£36 now, that would be well worth it - best to order it when you have your VIN though, as obviously the boot is a bit different to the non-hybrid models. 

Front and rear velour mats came with the car, so unless you live or work in a particularly muddy area, you won‚Äôt need mats - hang on, they might be an extra on the standard car? Not sure.

The only other thing I ‚Äòadded‚Äô was Gyeon fabric protector for the seats and mats - it isn‚Äôt cheap and it stinks to high heaven but in tests it came out top on performance. I did mine in March when it was a bit wet and cool and I think you need to let the car air for a day or so, but I just didn‚Äôt get the chance to do that and I think it was a full week before I realised it didn‚Äôt smell anymore!

I also put GTechniq Leather Guard protector on the leather bits, and Bilt Hamber double speed wax on the paintwork - it is a great wax and only needs to be done once or twice a year.

The HUD is OK but beware there are (at least) 2 options for what is displayed on the HUD, apparently there is an advanced display option that will show you e.g. local speed limit. The base HUD package is speed, directions (from the BMW GPS only, not from e.g. Google Maps in Carplay) and music selections.
