I bought a brand new Fiat Panda in 2005, about 3 months after a friend bought a brand new VW Golf. In the nearly 3 years I owned the Panda, nothing went wrong - except the brake discs rusting after I parked in torrential rain and left it alone for 3 weeks. 

My friend's Golf was in and out of the garage several times, a couple of times due to the fancy dual clutch automatic gearbox, DSG I think, which wasn't paired well with the 1.9 diesel and would sometimes stall (how do you stall without a clutch pedal?!), fanbelt failing after only 8000 miles, several times due to electrical issues, like the drivers window going down, but not up, brake light bulbs blowing 3 weeks after replacement, refusing to start without any indication as to why - the AA man said the battery was fine. Interestingly he's had the same problem with his current Skoda Kamiq. 

So, whilst we all know VWs are much better built than Fiats, my experience is the opposite.",2,3414111

I have a Fiat Panda Cross first registered in October 2008, which I acquired around October 2011.
Overall it's been an excellent car for what it is and proves very useful harrowing fields and grading the riding arena, for example. The lacquer coat over the paint has failed quite badly and I'm currently trying to find a replacement door seal for it, but it's at about 150,000 miles and soldiering on. I'm hoping I'll be able to get an EV replacement for it soon, but so far no-one has released a small 4x4 EV that would make a suitable replacement. Unlike the Audi A2 we had when we first got the Panda, we've not had any major failures (the Audi clutch failed at vast expense).",1,3414497

Probably all about ncap ratings and EU regs.
Some of which have little or no impact on saving your life-TPMS?
Yes I want my car to give me some protection but I really don't want stuff that adds significantly to the price that work away away in the background and cost a fortune to fix when they inevitably go wrong out of warranty.
Simple, basic, a-b motoring is all I want.

TPMS - legal requirement ported from European laws into ours. Sadly a significant number of accidents were caused by low tyre pressures before this became a thing:




In 2015, almost a third (32.6%) of accidents in the UK in which vehicle defects were a contributory factor were due to under inflated, defective or illegal tyres – including 112 serious accidents and 14 fatalities

Problem is that the current safety led systems are adding significantly to the price of seemingly all UK delivered cars - airbags everywhere, EBD, ESP, LDW, ACC, Blind Spot/Rear crossing warning etc. The FIAT Panda had little if any of these systems (depending on the age that we are harking back to) and it'll be interesting to see if these are stripped out to get down to a price - they clearly cannot be replaced with a mobile phone App.
Speaking personally, I'd be happy without them but accept that I'm different to the majority.

I don't mind safety systems (and to be honest I've found TPMS actually quite useful) - but I do mind all the junk they put inside.

Nobody needs 23 inches of touchscreens, web browsers, five zone climate control, televisions, or whatever to drive to the shops! How much of that stuff actually gets used?

Auto windscreen wipers, auto lights, cruise control (actually I don't even use that anymore), lane keep assist and good climate control. And ideally remote starting of the climate control. Then a few optional extras and job done 

Ah, actually....a reversing camera has become something of a must. But then maybe they'll buck the trend and make a car you can actually see out of when going backwards!

Can't imagine it'll make much different to me for a few years anyway, cause there's no way I'm buying a car before I've driven it and manufacturers seem to only want to sell EVs off waiting lists without even seeing the car nowadays ",1,3164942

It's true. My cynicism is more for amusement than disrespecting the cultural aspirations of 'The Fiat Panda'.

Indeed, if they sustain the basic design ethos then I agree with the sentimentality. The more variety of styles in car choice the better. 

We are facing the imminent danger of all BEVs heading towards indistinguishable pudding-shaped 80kWh cars, because nothing else quite works at the modal average of people.

Personally, I like big comfy low-riding 3-box limousines, but also tall narrow utilitarian vehicles/vans. So hurrah for the Panda! I have an increasing distain for anything that moves away from those polar opposites, as I think they are typically a compromise of mediocrity. donald's ideal driveway; Merc S 100kWh BEV and a Fiat Panda REx.

On the subject of whether my ideal driveway cars would have TPMS ... sure ... but I am not bothered either way, TPMS is for lazy people that can't be bothered to walk around their cars to check it is safe to drive off before getting in, or are not even competent to tell if their car is safe to drive.",1,3165011

I had a 2005 Fiat Panda, which was the basis for the 500 - it also had a button to make the steering lighter. A few years earlier, there was an amusing advert (for the Punto I think) that talked about it, a female driver said it made it nice and light so it was easy to park, the male driver said it had a special ""girly"" button. The girly button made it so light I could literally turn the wheel all the way around when stationary, using just my little finger. 

With electric assisted steering, it's very easy to adjust, unlike hydraulic assisted steering. Some say electric steering is numb, and vastly prefer hydraulic, but electric is way cheaper, lighter, and easier to package, so more and more new cars have it.

We had a 3 month plus wait for our e208 for a replacement door. There were some issues that needed resolving after the repair due to the length of time the vehicle had been left dismantled and masked off for spray painting. When they removed the tape it damaged the paint in a few places. They had also damaged a wheel and tyre. Orphan cars waiting parts in workshops just get shoved around to make space so give it a thorough going over when you collect it.",3,None

Our Fiat 500e (red) sustained front body damage on December 31st last year. Car body repairers still waiting for delivery of bonnet and front bumper from Fiat almost 4 months later.

It is, and it is to be welcomed, but not at the expense of causing other accidents.

This whole area is challenging to make morale judgements on, I was highlighting that difficulty because it is not so clear cut.

I am not saying better/worse, in fact I was 'actually' trying to say that one cannot declare one thing is better or worse than another, like, where you said better to be rear ended in a phantom braking event than running someone over. I don't think this can be said because one has to look at the likelihood versus severity, and if a car is phantom-braking 10 times an hour that is clearly worse than 1 phantom brake a day, which is worse than once in the car's lifetime. You've then got to decide, on the product of likelihood x severity, how many people survive being hit by a car, and how many die from being rear-ended (or rear-ending).",0,3365848

Yes, exactly.

I think as time goes on and these systems age and become even more 'fussy' drivers in general are going to finally have to accept that the car in front might well stop suddenly without warning, as we hear of more and more rear-end accidents from this sort of thing.

TBH, that is no bad thing, to assume the car in front might suddenly decide (for itself and for no good reason) to brake to a stop.

These days an assumption has built up that the car in front should never stop or slow down if they are behind it.",3,3365859

Nope. As I say the delay is VW trying to figure out how THEY can profit from this. They want to sell the fleet of V2G BEVs as if they were a power station to support the grid at peak times. They seem to have forgotten who owns the cars! 

For me CCS have gone down the wrong road saying you have to strap the inverter to the front of your house. They should’ve put the inverter in the car then any charing point could be 2-way. Many BEV manufacturers have ignored the official standard and use the Type-2 port for V2L, I wonder if/when a manufacturer will do the same with V2G?

You might want to look at the Ora Funky Cat - it has similar rounded styling to the 500 and Micra, and a significantly larger boot than the 500, still in a compact package.

her commute is 8 miles each way 3 times a week. We do the majority of our mileage in my Prius hence hers is so low. I’d like the extra range of the 42kW for the odd longer trips (circa 100 miles return) and also because I can see us using it more as it would be a good sized car for local trips.

Screenwash...
I usually use Preston, the yellow one which I dilute.
It really will look like an old man's dribbles whereas my Mokka looked like a horse taking a leak.
Long story short, I was recommended to use rainX screenwash, now I get smears.
Back to Prestone I guess.
Incidentally I dilute it with water saved from a dehumidifier so it's much better than tap water which I find can cause issues if it's hard water.

Crap at the bottom of the hatch seems to be a thing with modern cars, same problem on my last three cars which is a bit of a pain.

Wiper blades need to be the right size/shape/type for the vehicle but might give, my Mokka had a small spot that was being missed for a period of time but the blade seemed to give a bit with use and all was good. You could buy some better quality blades if the problem persists. Bosch make some decent blades but I'd not worry yet.

Thanks! I currently have the rainx inside and it’s the worst one yet full window smear and sun glare for like 5 minutes I literally popped the Prestone one (although think it’s blue) in my Amazon basket to get next week as it’s got the best reviews online so far but fear I’m just looking for the illusive unicorn… 
my left wiper doesnt ever cover the top left so the blade isn’t the issue they have been ok up to now it just misses a good 30cm square section of the top right and the windows are not very big to begin with to have all that not covered …. Roll on spring summer and autumn …. Thank you for your suggestions and nice to know other makes and models have the illusive ‘dribble’ too!",2,3401357

Indeed we removed the back of the back seat permanently. Only two screws and you are done and you can undo it anytime. You cannot remove the seat itself unfortunately.

Soon I am going to post some photos (or a video, don't know yet) in my travel journey how to organise the space in a 500e.
I have a convertible - that is even a bigger challenge since the door of the boot is very small.

Last year we were on the road for a month and it worked very nicely. And the amount of luggage is the same - one month or five months. We will do the laundry in between of course.
Since we are two photographers - the photo equipment will take a lot of space.
But it is not really a big issue.

I respectfully would say that 7 miles isn't a long journey to give a steady enough reading. You will have just set off, which takes an enormous amount of energy, possibly stop at road junctions and set off again. It's the same with a petrol car, the first few miles are the most thirsty. I travel 12 miles to work, the first few miles I'm getting 1.6-1.9 miles per kWh, after 5 miles or so it goes to 2-2.5 and by the 8 or 9th mile I'm at 3 miles per KWh and 3.6 by the time I arrive home or work. That's winter, in summer I get 5.2 to 5.6 miles per KWH, I've even had a couple of 6-6.2 miles per kWh but more typically 4.7-4.8. I always advise anyone contemplating an EV to buy the biggest battery version that can, because...winter.",1,None
206,3379444,-1,8522,"Jan 29, 2023","yeah you need to understand how the ""GOM"" works...

Different OEMs have taken slightly different approaches to how they display range. Tesla for instance seems to use the range meter as a bit more like a ""fuel tank size"" in that it always shows the same value when the battery is full. It doesnt account for how you drive or weather, it always uses the same fixed theoretical value to display remaining capacity. My old LEAF seemed to pay little heed as to how i drove the car, but did make some adjustments for weather, a warm day might say 100miles and a very cold one might say 70 or 80. In reality i was lucky to get 80 on the best days. The Merc and Enyaq both adjust their range depending on the last few miles driven (i dont know the sampling period exactly, but i would guess the last 10-20miles is used)

Each of these approaches has pros and cons.

If you take the Tesla approach, then you get the issue where the car says you have ""160miles"" of range, you drive 10miles up the road, and you've now only got ""130miles of range"". This gives you warm fuzzies when you get in and it shows 160miles, but makes you worried as the range is disappearing fast.

The last approach seems common amongst ""legacy"" automakers, as thats also how the fuel tank ""range"" estimates work in ICE cars, so i guess it makes sense to keep it consistent. It takes the consumption from the last few miles of driving, and then extrapolates that out to the full battery capacity. If you do that though, fully charged the car might only say ""80miles of range"", which people dont like as they might think their battery is somehow not fully charging, but at least its somewhat more accurate to what you will actually achieve on the road.

If you are doing short journeys and only drive 5 miles in freezing weather, the consumption will be extremely high due to the cabin heat (and possibly battery heating depending on the car). 

However if you actually drove a longer distance, the average consumption would be lower, as once the cabin and battery is up to temperature, the use drops off and thus the average falls.

It makes sense so long as you understand whats going on, and how your car displays the figures.

On average i seem to find i have about 25% less range in summer doing my 40mile commute. In summer the car will average around 3mi/kwh. in winter when its cold, ~2.3mi/kwh.

Real life range in the summer was about 150 max and winter it’s been about 110 average. I’ve tried various things to increase the mileage but no luck.

Do any other 500e drivers have issues with the intelligent speed assist system?, My La Prima seems to identify signs correctly, but after a period of not seeing a sign, it checks the sat nav, and it appears to convert the sat nav speed from km to miles.....

Just found this post as I'm experiencing the same thing. Intermittently the speed sign on the dash displays as 18 in a 30mph zone, 24 in a 40mph zone, etc. So you're correct that for some reason it occasionally thinks the speed limit is in kmh for some reason and then converts that to mph to display on the dash. I don't know if that's because it's falling back to the sat nav, but it seems that once it starts doing it, it continues to display the speed limit incorrectly even when passing speed signs that are clearly visible.

Think about the release lever to adjust the steering wheel. It goes with the steering.
People often think everything else does too including the bonnet release.

Are you able to attach a photo?

If you open the passenger door and take a photo of the area underneath where the passengers knees would go the lever should be towards the left but we might be able to figure it out from a picture.
I always struggle to find the lever to open the fuel flap if I hire a car, almost invariably with barely enough fuel to reach the nearest petrol station.

I have a worx hydroshot and just give the wheels a quick blast once a week.
Depending on the mileage you might need to use one of the colour changing spray on products and a soft paintbrush every other time but at least one in four times its worth getting to the inside edges of the wheels and giving them a good wipe over being careful not to knock the weights about too much.

Hi all,

So I have a Kona and love it, the other half loves driving the Kona because of the electric, but doesn’t want one as it’s to big 😅 we were considering a Zoe (she has a Mazda 2 at the moment) but really like the style and quirkyness of the Fiat 500e!

It’ll be a 2nd car so it’s not doing long journeys, but what’s the backseats like for kids? YouTube reviews seem a bit mixed with some people saying it’s fine and others not. We have a 5 year old (in a high back booster) and a 12 year old, but realistically 90% of the time the 12 year old would be in the passenger seat and just the 5 year old in the back (there might be the rare occasion where one of them has a friend in the car as well but that’s a really specific circumstance not the norm). If it was all 4 of us we’d be using my Kona, but for when the other half is doing school runs and the odd trip to town etc, what’s peoples thoughts on the 500e? Anyone here have kids and use the back seats? How do they find it

I do totally understand, the Zoe is going to be more practical… but the 500e is a characterful little car!

Thanks!

Well the current small hatchbacks on sale you have these three using the same platform just a different shell:

Peugeot e-208 / Citroen e-C4 / Corsa-e

These two:

The Renault Zoe / Nissan LEAF 🙈

The only two I'd suggest, the Born making the ID.3 look like plain porridge.

ID.3 / Cupra Born ✅

Then the small segment:

The Fiat which I think looks ace:

Fiat 500e ✅

There are some funnies with how different cars have implemented the charging standards and how chargers such as the Zappi interact with them. Generally the solution is to tweak the Zappi settings.

I have resorted atm to using eco rather than eco+ and have set the cars charging speed (1-5 on the 500e) to level 2. This seems to maximise my PV input (its just over a 2kw system) on a sunny / cludy day with a few hundred watts being drawn from grid when a cloud passes.",0,3226854

So that's what it's doing!

Exactly the same behaviour from my ID3 / Zappi set-up.

I just watch what's going on using the Zappi app regularly then scoot outside, unplug, replug to get it going again. (Yes, I'm retired)

TL;Dr - it is not working completely, but is improved with the latest VW software and the thread includes the best Zappi settings to minimise the issue.

It sounds like it needs VW to change the car's functionality to resolve the issue. If VW
have implemented the functionality to protect the 12V battery they may be reluctant until they are sure there are no 12V issues. 

Probably similar to the over enthusiastic ID3 traction battery heating, which again may be changed / reduced by VW if they get more confidence in long term battery health.",0,None

Interesting efficiency comparison 500e vs M3 LR. We also have these cars (and an ID3...and a Honda NSX!) but I haven't taken the time you have to understand this. Surprising in some ways given Tesla are generally regarded as being ahead of the pack in terms of battery management / efficiency.

The issue is solely to do with charging from a standard home outlet, using a 13 A plug in charge point. They draw a steady 10 A for hours on end, and sometimes that is just more than the outlet can safely handle, leading to overheating. There's also the small risk from an open PEN fault with charging like this.

A properly installed charge point will have all the required safety protection and will also be wired to a supply that can safely carry a high current for hours on end, so is a very much lower risk overall.

Public charging is just as safe as charging from a properly installed home charge point, and a lot safer than charging from a 13 A plug in charge point..",1,3177671

Why does the type of CU make any difference?

Charge points are best wired via a connection box to the tails, not a good idea to wire one to a CU unless there is no other option, really. The reasons are mainly that few CUs have the capacity to add a double pole RCBO, or RCD and MCB, fitting a high continuous load circuit into a CU may present an increased risk from heat build up, particularly for older boards with plastic cases and often the wiring run can be simpler and less disruptive if it comes from the tails rather than the CU.",0,3178603

Most EVSE installers would most likely take the feed directly from the tails at the meter (raul there than adding a new circuit to an existing consumer unit or fuse box), and use a small dedicated consumer unit just for the new charger circuit, to avoid the need to check/test/upgrade/replace the existing consumer unit. This allows the new install to be fully compliant with the regs and be fully tested independently of the existing installations. Obviously if there are issues with the meter position/cut-out that need addressing first then this work would be additional, but it leaves the existing consumer unit untouched.",0,3178603

EBay take no responsibility for the safety of electrical items on their site. I bought an adaptor for Shucko to 3 pin from eBay and when I used it the fuse tripped. The photo shows the adaptor partly disassembled, and the pencil shows where the earth connector and live connector touch when the shucko is inserted into the adaptor. EBay were not interested, the only recourse is to get your money back if you’re still alive.

Arnold Clark are that car dealer universally known for great service, NOT.
If you want to get contractual, remember your contract is with the supplying dealer, not FIAT. 
Reread the terms of the contract. Look for terms that say something similar to "" subject to survey"". If Arnold Clark or any if their agents performed the survey they are responsible for delivering a fit for purpose charger, including one with a lead long enough to reach the FIAT's charging port. If Arnold' Clark's agent ( this might be Wallbox) were negligent in their survey and did not measure the distance accurately, they are responsible under the terms of the contract which they signed to make good, I. E. swop for a longer cable.

Now it comes down to how you want to enforce the contract. You are looking at a cost of say £250 parts and £150 labour to replace the charging cable. Instructing a solicitor to write a letter might consume most of that with uncertainty as to whether you would recover all your costs. So get a quote for supply and replacement of a longer cable. Phone up your local trading standards officer and see if they can offer assistance or advice.

The wallbox comes in a box in the boot of the car with the Fiat 500e so no survey is involved, it just seems an oversight by Fiat and/or the Easy Wallbox Company not to be so penny pinching in not putting a standard cable of reasonable length onto their pre packed charger unit.

Just very badly translated, I think. This charge point is advertised in countries in Europe that have load limiting trip switches on their incoming supply, like France and, I believe, Spain, as reducing the risk of blackouts, not as a way of providing power during them.

These load limiting trip switches are a pretty standard arrangement in parts of Europe, where the consumer can choose to pay a higher tariff in order to be able to draw more current from the supply. The original Italian advert makes it clear that the ""prevention of blackouts"" feature is just load limiting, so the charge point can be set to not allow the current drawn by the charger in the car to exceed the set supply trip current limit. Resetting the Italian equivalent of the French household interrupteur différentiel after it's blacked the house out because too much current has been drawn is a nuisance, one that this thing is designed to reduce.",1,3186531

That car is advertised as having a (extra-urban) range of 668 miles (from the official mpg and the fuel tank capacity). That is a complete joke, the very best I ever managed to get out of it was a range of only 607 miles, and in winter that range dropped massively to only 506 miles.

The thing lost over 160 miles of its advertised range in winter. My wife's Yaris was actually worse, that didn't get as close as the Prius to meeting its advertised range. You will find it's exactly the same for ever other car every sold - the specs never come close to reality.

The issue with EVs is that the range is stated in the WLTP testing, rather than the mpg (which has to be divided into the usable fuel tank capacity to get the range). This means that reviews and advertising for ICE vehicles rarely ever mentions the range. As another example, the first few cars I owned were all Minis.

Ah, interesting; that explains a lot. I went to Brighton yesterday which for me was about 85 miles. If I couldn't get a charging point I planned a 20 min top-up at Cobham Services on the M25.

The indicated range on any EV is only ever an estimate but with most it is an educated estimate in that it adjusts the indicated range based on how the car was driven over the recent past. Many of us call it a ""guestimate"" and the range indicator we often call the ""Guess'o'Meter"" or GoM  Drive the car hard then not only will you get less actual range but from then on the car will assume that it will be driven hard and the estimate will be lower. Drive the car gently for a period and the car assumes more gentle driving for the future and so the estimate will go up. 

Also... the faster you drive the less range you will get so you seeing a drop in indicated range reduction when you drove slower is to be expected.",0,3165013

That was the very best figure, though. Even under optimum conditions there was a ~9% range shortfall compared with the spec. In winter the range was only about 76% of the specification figure, so about a 24% shortfall.

That's comparable with some EVs. My car has a spec that gives a WLTP range of 292 miles, in reality is does around 270 miles in ideal conditions (an 8% shortfall versus the spec) and about 210 miles in worst case conditions (a 28% shortfall versus the spec).

Hi, I am looking to swap the wifes car from a kia picanto to the fiat 500 electric Red edition. I am used to electric as i have had an Ipace for the last year. Does the fiat have programmable pre conditioning so the the heater comes on at a set time each day, can it be set via an app and manually in the car ?
My ipace has a heated screen but i have never used it as i set preconditioning every day before going to work, would this work the same in the fiat ?
Due to the wife wanting red interior, she cannot have heated seats, no idea why but there you are, so it would be an extra £300 just for the heated wipers, are these any good, and if the car pre conditions, do you need them.

Hi all
I’m a first time car owner and got myself the Fiat 500e.
I really love it but everything being so tight in London and me not being the best at parking I scratched badly my wheel today. You can imagine how gutted I was for my brand new car 

So I wanted to ask - do you normally fix yours as soon as damaged?
Shall I take it where I bought it from to fix or just find someone locally to repair?
Is there any type of protection I can add to avoid dents and scratches?
Thanks

If you're likely to scratch them often, don't bother repairing them until you're about to get rid of the car. You can get ""rim protectors"" but they can often do little if the contact with a kerb is heavy enough. If they're standard silver wheels (not fancy diamond cut faces) then maybe a cheap touch up pen from the likes of Halfords can make them look a little less damaged...",0,None

Great, I wasn’t sure if it’s best to keep repairing them when it happens or leave it! Considering I scratched them on day 5, the likelihood of this happening again is high 😃

504,3059727,36,96388,"Aug 3, 2021","We have had a 500E La Prima for around 6 weeks now and we can confirm there are some issues which we suspect are SW related.

There are inconsistences with the relationship between battery charge level and range. i.e. We charged to 100% and the range dropped by 23 miles before the battery capacity reduced to 99%. The range then reduced by 2 miles when the charge level reduced to 98% Regardless of driving style I would expect there to be a more accurate correlation between these 2 measurements. 1% = 23 miles and then 1% = 2 miles is not very helpful.

The speed and range were set for MPH and and Miles respectively. 3 times now, these settings have randomly switched to Kmh and Km and had to be reset in the units settings. When I saw the speedo at 47 I though a speeding ticket would be arriving soon but then realised the display was in Km/h

With the car switched off and locked, when you plug in a charge cable the radio bursts into life for around 20 seconds.

The battery capacity varies quite a bit from charge to charge. On 17th July a 100% charge indicated a potential range of 205 Miles in SHERPA mode. On 30th July, 100% indixcated 165 Miles in SHERPA mode.

This is not SW related but we also have concerns with the E-Mode selection switch on the centre console. Twice now, my partner has accidentally put the car into SHERPA mode whilst I was driving around 70mph. This causes the car to suddenly brake and reduce speed to 50mph. The E-Mode switch is on the passenger side of the centre console. She mistook it for the volume control. In left hand drive vehciles this would not be such a problem.

I am logging these type of occurrences and will present them to the dealer and FIAT customer services as appropriate but it does look like there should, perhaps, have ben a bit more regression testing.

Other than that, we love the car and would recommend it.",1,None

Yss, I managed to get to the manual last night. It seems that the button toggles between Charge/Schedule/Stop in some way which is (to me) badly described in the manual. One of the few cases where a flowchart would make sense, I think.

It took me 3 different computers to access the manual. My phone would open it from the QR code in the short printed guide, but not download it. If I shared the same URL to my laptop, I was given a login page (which seemed to know of 2 of my email addresses already, but wouldn't let me reset passwords, would register a 3rd email - but without a password, so that is lost too). Finally, my chromebook did open the QR code link and allow me to save the document. Direct link (hosted by Fiat, not bypassing any access control) is below.

There is a Government grant to help with the installation of a home charger, this usually covers 50% of the installation but there is criteria that has to be met, so worth checking that online.

To protect your energy suppliers street wiring to your property, there is a fuse, this fuse needs to be 100A to run your charger at 32A. This is the case in most modern property that the fuse is 100A but older property it can be only 80A, in which case you charger will be installed at 16A rating and charge your vehicle at only 3Kw’s per hour, after wiring loses. So this is worth checking, the good news is that your energy supplier should up grade this fuse, free of charge, but of course will require planning.

Charging loses, when charging your vehicle allow for about 10% of the electricity being drawn down through the charger to be lost in heat in the wiring and the vehicles inverter. For example, 6.7kw’s per hour comes from my charger but only 6Kw’s per hour actually goes into the battery. This is worth noting if you are calculating a window of cheap energy for overnight charging, to ensure there is enough to cover the miles next day.

I have a podpoint charger, I have had it 4 years and has been no bother, it’s okay but there are better smarter chargers out there now.

I didn’t know all this when I started out with EV’s, so just in case it is of help and good luck with you prospective purchase, once you have an EV, there is no going back.",0,None

I didn’t know all this when I started out with EV’s, so just in case it is of help and good luck with you prospective purchase, once you have an EV, there is no going back.

Thank you for contacting Fiat.

Following your recent enquiry and as discussed with the customer care agent over the phone, we recommend completing the operations below:

Ensure that you are in an area that has a good internet coverage, proceed with a radio restart followed by a key cycle: from the radio menu: Vehicle> Settings> Reset> Radio restart.
Once the radio has restarted, do key off - key on.

Should you continue to experience any issues, repeat the radio restart + key cycle up to 3-4 times.

If this still does not work, then try with a further Factory reset: rom the radio menu: Vehicle> Settings> Reset> Factory settings.

Once the radio has restarted, do key off - key on.

Please do not hesitate to contact our Customer Relations team from Monday to Friday between 09:00 and 18:00 on 00800 3428 0000, choosing option number 2.

Hi all, just joined the forum.
Following a sucessfull test drive, we are very keen to place an order on a Passion in Celestial Blue. The dealership have not been particularly great, so I do not have any loyalty, so would be willing to search around for a better deal than list price.

Has anyone been successful in achieving an order under list price (less the UK government grant and fiat deposit contribution). Carwow is mostly coming back with list price, with one exception but delivery charges from so far away eat into any discount.

Thanks for the reply. 

Further problems since my post means it's going in on Tuesday. 

I understand the statements saying we're in the early life cycle but I don't think it's acceptable. In my case it hinders a safety system and one that manufactures should be serious about.

Click to expand...

Charging more slowly can be kinder to the battery, but to a point…
rapid charging (50+kw) most damaging but can still be done many times
but the charging you do at home/destinations (7kW 32A) doesn’t make much difference, the lower settings are there for people with restrictions, such as 60A home fuse, so not enough capacity to have a full 7kW 32A, instead they’ve got 3.6kW 16A outlet, or others only have a 13A socket, so use the granny charger, these are limited to 10A (but could be put down to 6A, if you have the settings/need to), to protect the wiring/socket/connection as you don’t usually have something at 13A running full chat for maybe 12hrs, causing any weakness to overheat & possibly set fire
Though the lower Amps you charge at, the less efficient the charging is, so that’ll cost more, but this is only a tiny amount

Trip was typically nightmarish. We bought it from a garage in Cheshire about 100miles away. We asked them to fully charge it as we didn’t want to have to charge on our first trip. Despite a weeks notice and nagging them, when we turned up, it was sat on the charger. We left the dealership with about 60% charge. Thought we would pop into the local Morrison’s and use their charger. That was a bit of a mistake - the Friday crowd were in shopping and the charger is by the in ramp. Reversing across the traffic was a challenge! Had the usual first time charging a new car challenges but got to meet a lovely local guy in an iPace! Needless to say neither of us could get the Genie Point charger working (they had network problems). So gave up and set off.

Stopped at the osprey charger on the A55. It worked ok but it was getting dark and was raining by then. The hotel sold us a coffee but they were booked up and no chance of any food 🙁 Pick up was 4pm - finally got home about 9pm.

Click to expand...

Drove the Mini e, BMW i3S (we own the regular BMW i3 already) and Peugeot e-208 all in 1 afternoon last summer 2020. Wife was choosing her next car. Was driving an Audi S3 (300bhp+) at the time.

Mini e runs the BMW i3s running gear -181bhp motor (instead of 184bhp in the i3S) but to the front wheels. It is a powerful and fun car to drive but we found the ride too harsh and unsettled overall for our British urban pot holed and bumpy roads but excellent if the tarmac was smooth. As there is so much torque going through the front wheels you get torque steer pretty much all the time on acceleration which the cheeky nature of the car urges you to do all the time! And we test drove on a nice sunny day. Would be worse in the rain.- a big no-no for me. I prefer rear wheel drive (eg-i3) as a result. A pain to get in the back as 3 door only, but once there actually ok for headroom but if you are tall driver rear legroom is going to be an issue. Pretty tiny boot and no frunk as this is based on the ICE Mini platform. Without the sunroof, car will feel claustrophobic and cramped but actually plenty of room for front passengers. Well equipped overall. 
As it is a fun car, the powerful running gear counts against it, as the range will be poor if you drive it in a fun/Mini sort of way. Pretty efficient drivetrain as 7+ years of BMW e-platform experience has gone in to it (much better than the similar battery sized Honda e) but you still have to expect 90-110 miles real world range.

500e has a bigger battery but just felt more modern. Same issues with cramped rear. Not as powerful but more than fast enough and no real torque steer as not as much torque I guess going through the front wheels. 500e rides better also- but close overall.

After driving all 3 last year, wife chose the Peugeot e-208. Liked the looks of it above all else (subjective) but thought the cabin was Audi like in quality and build. Another surprise. After almost 5 months she still absolutely loves it and to be fair I have been very very impressed with it. We both love our sports cars and they should be fun above all else. The e-208 is certainly that. GT model fully loaded with pano sunroof. Seems to better and more fun than the Corsa e which shares it's platform. 

I know you asked about the Mini e but e-208 is proper 5 seater (at a squeeze)- Mini strict 4 seater only and cramped at that. e-208 has a more useful boot. Bigger battery at 50kWh and faster charging speed at up to 100kw (Mini 33kWh battery?-Still only 50kW charge speed). 

500e- 85kW which is fast enough to charge a 40-45kWh battery. 

And the 208 is Europes best selling car, which came as a surprise to us, but not really now we come to think of it. Peugeot 2008, Europes 2nd best selling car to boot! Yes they are both available as petrol, diesel and electric models but they must have done something right to knock the typical Ford Fiesta, Renault Clio or VW Golf off their perches!

If it is between the 500e and Mini I would take the 500e. It is a proper and very modern high quality feeling (la Prima edition sampled only) EV with a decent sized battery and range and good enough charge speeds. If you can live with the smallish boot (very small on the convertible as it has small boot opening also) and cramped rear space. It will be an excellent commuting car as fun also.

Mini e is a converted EV on an ageing platform but then again is tried and tested. BMW/Mini will be releasing a new ground up Mini EV in conjunction with Great Wall Motors of China (I believe) in the coming months.Probably early to mid 2022.",2,3005868

I enjoy driving our little Fiat 500e over in California and feel one of these would make a perfect runabout when we are over in the UK. Most of the non EV parts are standard Fiat 500 so in theory it shouldn't be too expensive to maintain standard wear items, tyres, brakes, wipers etc. Some inexpensive reliable Fiat 500e 2013 models here in California can be found for less than $5000. Looking at the cost to ship from the US to the UK should be less than $1000 according to : How Much Does Shipping a Car Overseas Cost? - CostHelper

Once this pandemic has declined, I'm sorely tempted to buy another 500e then pack up our current 500e for the UK but not sure about the current UK car inspection requirements. Looking at the VAT impact it should be zero as it has been owned by us outside the EU (if that even matters anymore) for almost two years. Essentially everything except the drive train and some of the trim is standard Fiat 500 especially safety elements so I would think there would be no additional inspection items required?

Here's an example of a 2016 500e for $5991 https://www.cars.com/vehicledetail/detail/828502330/overview/

Any thoughts - or am I totally crazy?

It is a city car and the range of cheaper model is fine for commuting or short journeys. Under £20K is a good entry price point too, but quite low on spec. Like the Mini and Honda, I wouldn't expect any meaningful discount! I do expect good PCP/PCH prices though.
