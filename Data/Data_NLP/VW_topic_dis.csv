2203,0,2017-07-04,"I can confirm that Car-Net App connect refers to connecting to a phone. There are 3 options for this depending on your phone - Apple CarPlay, Android Auto and Mirror-link. I tried Mirror-link but the number of apps was very limited and I did not find it worked very well. However I use Android Auto every day due to the excellent Google Maps.

When you receive a message in Android Auto via SMS, whatsapp or other messaging app you get a bar which appears. Tap on it and it reads it to you, than asks do you want to reply. Say yes and you can dictate the message. It reads it back to you to confirm it is correct, and then you can tell it to send. Very useful for keeping your eyes on the road.

You can ask it to phone or navigate to someone in your contacts by voice which is pretty nice. Waze is coming to Android Auto which should be useful. The other category of apps all relate to music and audio - I use Amazon Music (for my subscription), Smart-audio player (audio books), Beyond Pod (podcasts) and Jet-audio (mp3 collection). Other good options include Google Music, Spotify, Pandora, Tune-in radio, Stitcher and Deezer.

Car-net can actually refer to 2 other things. 
1. The car-net app which allows you to connect remotely via the sim and use the e-manager. (The SIM is not user changeable and the module is hidden away in the car somewhere.) 
2. Car-Net Guide and Inform - extra info on the Discover Pro infotainment if you provide it with a data connection."
2887,0,2014-11-10,"In my Leaf i have experienced 'Tortoise Mode' followed by a flat bed ride to the nearest RC.... 250m away from where we stopped.

On the M4 in Wales heading East, I approached the services that I had planned to hit with 18 miles remaining however the next services was 15 miles away and had 20% remaining so I decided to go for it and test the Leaf. (previously using hypermiling I managed to extend the battery life to over a mile/% right down to the last few percent.

What I didn't take into account is just how many steep hills there are on the M4 in Wales and when I needed a lorry, there wasn't one.

As we got to 6 miles remaining we only had 4 miles to go, however approach the services was a steep hill and half way up, found that the 'Tortoise' appeared and the car suddenly lost power and slowed right down to around 20mph. we just made the brow of the hill, no more than half a mile, before the car cut out altogether. luckily the steering stayed use-able and we free wheeled down the hill off the slip road into the services before coming to a stop about 50m up the slip road.

Luckily there was road work and we fell just inside the free recovery, so was picked up within 30 minutes and dropped off 250m into the services for a rapid charge.

I wont be making that mistake again, although I really don't like the fact that from around 5 miles/5% ish the car gives you absolutely no way of knowing how low you are. Surely the battery % could still show."

CASE RESOLVED!

Took the car on the motorway on Saturday - Same problem.

Decided to use the travel assist feature.

Pressed the travel assist button at which point the display said ‘ACC deactivated’. Thought that was strange. Pressed it again, same response. Car would not switch on travel assist feature. Just kept saying ‘ACC deactivated’.

So I then pressed the 0/1 cruise control button. Car seemed to turn off cruise control (it was not even on).

Pressed travel assist button again and this time it worked okay. Pressed it again and it switched off okay.

Thought that seemed like a glitch so tried the car in e-mode again, and this time it worked as normal!

Used the car all weekend and everything works fine.

Seems like some of these models may be suffering from glitches after charging so recommend if you have an issue, try using the features/pressing all the buttons to see if it helps reset anything.

Cheers for your help!

1902,0,2018-01-16,"a) Have you tried via the internet website from a laptop etc ( or laptop )--- and not via the app ? 

b) bear with me on this one:
i) go to car, sit in, turn on the ignition, in the centre console system go to CAR, settings, units and change to km so the speedo, trip, total-Odo etc read in km. Count to ten ( trust me). 
ii) as you then turn off the ignition, note the Odo km reading 
iii) go back gain to car net registration , and enter the km reading number you took in (ii) 
see if that works.

Something to do with some cars needing to send to VW a km reading, rather than in miles via the built in SIM. 
Turning the ignition off seems to trigger a data refresh send to the VM carnet server."

I don't really like the emphasis on time manager as that was never my main function. To be fair this morning it managed to correctly pull out my first appointment for the day and provide a route for it, which is better than Google is doing on its own at the moment. I have Composition Media so my only car navigation is Android Auto. Strangely when I select ""Start Navigation"" at the bottom of the route screen it opens my backup offline navigation ""HereWeGo"" which has no defaults set rather than Google maps which is set as the default navigation on my phone. It could be useful if they sorted that out.

My phone suggested I force close the app today though as it was using 1.46% of battery an hour. I have a 3600mAh battery so that is quite a lot for one app. Something to keep an eye on if you are using it."
250,0,2022-06-17,"Assuming the Arteon is the same as the Golf and Passat GTEs (it sounds like it is) the 12v battery charges from the HV battery.

Some EVs have issues with the 12v battery not charging properly, the GTE is not typically one of them. If the 12v battery were flat you would most likely get lots of random alarms. You aren't, so it isn't 🙂 

Separate to charge level the 12V battery powers the various 'computers' that control the car. Whilst these go into a 'sleep' mode when you turn off the ignition they do not all switch off completely. It is possible that something has got corrupted, and disconnecting the 12v battery does a 'cold start' on the system and clears it.

Equally it is possible that a sensor or sensors have gone out of tolerance in such a way that the car thinks the ICE needs to run when it doesn't. You would hope that this would trigger a fault code, but depending on the failure mode and extent of the failure not necessarily."

To be honest, after only a month of owning the car, I know for sure I won't be renewing the service if they ask money for it as it's so unreliable. It can easily take 3 minutes to log on, a minute to respond to each action and even then they usually fail requiring you to refresh and try again. I'd hoped it'd be something I'd be able to use whilst eating breakfast to make sure the car was warm, but it's usually quicker to go outside, open up the car and set a timer for 5 minutes time.

Not the initial tank of fuel but it has been the same tank for a while (1400 miles or so).
I basically use the electric motor most days and fire up the ICE about once a week when I take a journey that runs the battery low. Have also done about 300 motorway miles earlier this month which used the ICE for a long period of time.

Petrol tank has about a quarter tank left so not sure if that has anything to do with it?

Also the engine runs until you stop the car (at traffic lights) at which point it shuts off. Then I've been switching it back to emode which stationary. At which point I pull off from the lights (no heavy load just very gentle acceleration). It then fires up and switches back to hybrid mode again? Has never done anything like this before?"

An update should be so; functionality improved upon; last downgrade was poor, visually appealing at first, functions less than before.

Unsure if newer GTE models using this app get more functionality, certainly not in my case!
Whole point of electric consumption against petrol consumption is to drive emissions reductions and efficiency gains; this is why it would be great if these figures were available.

1723,0,2018-06-11,"Most VW group cars can connect to Samsungs using the rSAP blutetooth protocol - you might see ""remote"" on the screen or in the bluetooth settings.

If your car can spit out a wifi hotspot (using its ""hijacked"" data), you can use the phone for apps and calling/messaging apps that use wifi.

When your phone then sends streamed music back to the car it becomes surreal like ""Inception"".

It will still have the instant torque of an electric motor, it’s just that it will be masked by the gearbox.

The DSG gearbox is actually a pretty good box, but I’m not sure why they’ve used it in this application.

The DSG gearbox can be a bit dimwitted/slower if you’re requesting a gear different to that which has been pre-selected, ie you’re in 3rd, the gearbox map will pre-select 4th but if you request 2nd it has to to undo the pre-selection and there’s a delay.

Most days I do tend to know where I am.
However knowing where the car is, i.e. has the other driver left ( or got ) to where they are, or knowing how far away it is from me, is far more useful as default.

Not sure what you mean "" have an icon"" -- are you expecting to use CarNet functions, from within the car ? 

If that's what you mean, no, you use the eManager subsection of the CAR menu

Note I think the steady state ""fully warm"" temp is around a display number of 90-92.

So 50 is the first number the display shows, it's not the working best temp.
You could be sold that at 50 the engine is not at its most economical running temperature. 

It's why journeys of battery-range plus 2-4 miles are so so painful, as you know the ICE has to be used but will be burning more fuel than you'd like. Even if you kick it in on purpose for the middle 4-5 for example, trying to then reach destination on the last lot of electrons."

Ah, that would be very frustrating. As an example I drove Inverness to Edinburgh return yesterday. Just over 300 miles in the eGolf, with ACC the whole way on the A9 and M90.

2849,0,2015-04-25,"Forgive the rant below but I am having what I suspect is an almost unique problem with registering with Car-Net.

The reason why it is probably unique is that I am in possession of one of the very few ex-demo eGolfs, bought from a retailer that is not an e-mobility specialist. 

For that reason I have been unable to benefit from what I assume is the normal initial induction in which such things as registration with Car-Net is supervised and assisted. 

Because it is not new it appears not to benefit from the included three-year free subscription to Car-Net. 

Consequently when I try to add my car to my account I am presented with a popup which states that I have to arrange subscription billing details before proceeding any further. This is annoying enough, but when I click Continue to be taken to the ""biller's website"" (whatever that is) nothing happens.

I can't proceed with adding my car because I haven't arranged subscription details. And I can't arrange subscription details because I am still stuck on the Car-Net website.

The next issue is who do I speak to to solve this? Even now, nowhere have I seen any information about how much a subscription is, now whether it is true that a used eGolf, even a VW Approved Used eGolf, does not get a free subscription.

The retailer who sold me this car is clueless. My local e-Mobility specialist does't have the answer either and in any case has minimal incentive to help me. And even VW's Customer Services department have no idea what to do.

I feel like I have plummeted down a black hole created by an aggregation of loose ends VW have left in planning their e-Mobility service design.

1813,0,2018-02-05,"Hi Steve,

Thanks for your reply. I've done a few tests this weekend using other methods than the Car-Net app. 
Using a Car-Net API I've managed to logon to the Car-Net service and my car using my computer where I can extract information and also control features such as turn on/off charing and so on.

However, using the Car-Net API I discovered that I can also see the last known connection for the car, see below:

-- Status --
Next service inspection: 682 Dag(ar) / 28.000 km
Distance: 2.107 km
Last connected: 05.02.2018 09:39

In my case, I parked my car at work this morning at approx 07. I was able to access the car until 09:39 and then it stopped. 

My conclusion is defenately that the car itself is the source of error as it apparently fails to keep a connection with Car-Net. Not sure if this is due to poor connectivity or something else.

Working with IT I could only assume the following:

If the car fails to connect to the Car-Net servers xx times it goes in to sleep mode until it's started or ignition is turned on. A failed connection could be heavy load on the servers, no 3/4g connection or similar. This could be a default setting in the cars not to drain the data usage. If cellular coverege is below xx% the car sleeps until started. Talking to programmers at my office my theory seems plausible.

If you are unfamiliar with Car-Net API and how that works I would be happy to explain that topic further.

Rest assure I won't stop working on this topic until a working solutions has been presented by VW.

Best regards,

Nicklas (Sweden)"

Which means that, subject to further studies being carried out on my behalf for feasibility, there is no law standing in the way of installing a towbar, and consequently fitting a cycle carrier. 

What I am trying now to clarify is what the available load is, as I understand the train weight refers to the combination of the car, the trailer and the load that it carries. Given the substantial weight of the car itself, it doesn't sound like it can tow much of a load, but it should allow for a weight of 50 or so kg for a cycle carrier and two or three cycles."

I mean that the fewer apps to maintain, update, create etc. the more work is needed. There's already three delivery targets: iOS, Android, Web Browsers. They don't need to multiply that by multiple regional variations.

They clearly need to get tied up to AWS (Amazon Web Services) or Azure or (another global cloud service provider) and get some resiliency in their servers and apps. In these days, the ""A server is down"" is more of a commercial expenditure excuse than any IT failure. Don't follow the example of BA!

Car-net is not the same as App Connect, which allows you to put certain functions of your smartphone on the dashboard screen.

749,0,2019-11-03,"I bought a new 2019 eGolf on 29 September here in the USA. Installed the VW app on my Android phone and used it that weekend just great. Then, VW announced the roll-out of the new 2.0 app. The original app stopped working and I deleted it from my phone. The new ""app"" isn't really an app at all. When I click on it, all it does is open a web browser on the VW website where I then have to enter my email address, click enter, wait... enter my password, click enter, wait... select my car from what might be a list of cars if I owned more than one VW, wait... enter my four digit PIN for my car, click enter, wait... Then it brings up a screen showing the status of my car. Then, if I click on any of the categories - say if I click on the battery, I then wait for a few seconds and it brings up the same visual display that I used to have on the old app. 

It's frustrating that with the old app, my phone was my token to get into the system and I didn't have to go through multiple levels of user name, password, and PIN security. I could just open the app and see the status of my car and turn on my defrost. 

Yesterday morning was the first time it's been below freezing when I was getting ready to leave, so I went through the multiple steps of logging in to try and tell my car to turn on climate control and turn on the defrost. When I clicked on the button to turn on the climate control, the screen just went blank. It wouldn't work. Tried rebooting. No luck. 

When I got downstairs, I got on my computer and tried using the VW website to access my car and turn on the climate control. The Firefox browser told me the VW website's security certificate had expired and it was not safe and would not allow me to open the website. Then I tried Google Chrome. That allowed me to open the website, go through the multiple layers of login, and finally allowed me to turn on the climate control in my car.... but by then it was time for me to leave and a moot point.

I had to wake up at 6am and wipe the snow off my girlfriend's SUV and then scrape the ice off. Then I would sit in the car with the engine running, revving the engine until the windshield was clear enough to be able to drive. Several times I got halfway down the road and had to stop because I couldn't see anything as it had iced up again. I ended up buying some special blue de-icing fluid to put in the wiper fluid box which dissolved the ice. All that came out of the air vents for the first 15 minutes was cold air.

And even if the SMS CarNet pushes up the average quiescent drain, I don't think you need to worry about it not lasting 4 weeks.  .. I somehow doubt the DC-DC convertor would turn-on and drain the HV battery .. but who knows? 

Anyway the HV battery itself will have it's own massive self discharge quiescent current .. (anyone measured battery droop over time?). That will be a few orders of magnitude larger than the idle ECU's.

Okay just an update for you all and thanks for the help thus far!

To clarify the make and model to avoid confusion:

VW Arteon saloon ehybrid. This is the version with the 1.4 Petrol Engine and 13kw HV Battery. 2021 model.


More info on problem: It’s specifically 13mph that triggers the car into hybrid mode. Doesn’t matter if you’re gently touching the accelerator or almost coasting - 13mph seems to be the trigger point.

Today I experimented by:

Turning the aircon up a notch. Turning off fully, on fully, etc – Result: no difference
Filled up about 10 litres of new petrol – Result: no difference
Hammered it on the motorway at a low gear for about 5 miles running the ICE at between 4-5000rpm - Result: no difference
Charged the car fully using a commercial charger at Sainsbury’s – Result: When pulling off and hitting 13mph the car tried to switch back to hybrid mode. I got to the traffic lights and the car tried to put some charge in to the HV battery (normal for hybrid mode when slowing down). It appeared to recognise the battery was full as the charging dial wouldn’t accept anything, at which point the ICE turned off! I switched it back to EV mode manually and it stayed this way for a mile or two. This is similar to what happened yesterday when I gave it a full charge. Then after a mile or two (when some Battery power had been used up), it switched back to hybrid and the problem was back. Any thoughts on this?

I have a few motorway miles to do tomorrow so am planning to:

Burn the petrol down to the red and see if it lets me run in E mode
While burning the petrol down I’m planning to keep the ICE revs high to see if that adds any charge to the 12v Battery. Not sure if the car is wired this way but let me know your thoughts?
If that all fails, disconnect it overnight and see if that resets anything.


And a side thought – Do you think it’s possibly just the car trying to charge the 12v battery in the event it’s low? Wondering if that might be the case as I've not been using the ICE much for two/three months, other than once a week for a couple of miles, and a 300 mile motorway journey at the beginning of the month.
Any thoughts?

Depends on the car. In a car I am not familiar with it is true that I might need to glance at the approximate location of the button, but it is a glance which can often be achieved with hands still on the steering wheel before reaching out. A touch screen you need to focus on the point you want to press, brace your hand against something so you have half a chance at hitting the right spot, then watch the screen to see that the touch was accepted and the system reacted.

I'm sorry, but touch screens for operation while actually driving, including [or, 'especially'] HVAC and radio functions are a road safety hazard."

Having driven the Ampera and Soul long enough to know, HVAC and radio functions are impossible to control as quickly conveniently and safely as the Espace by an order of magnitude.

Maybe the Tesla has perfectly designed touch screen functions, but others don't.

When I want to select a particular radio station on the Soul it necessitates taking eyes of the road for 5 seconds. It is really badly designed.

Or, there is a factory installed SIM hidden deep in the car, which sends sms texts to VW, and can receive + interpret return ones. ( per GTEJesper append #6 above )

2901,0,2015-05-29,"Had a recent experience of running out of main battery, you generally get a warning at 18 miles range and then once you get into the red zone on the fuel meter (rather than a particular range) the car will start switching to Eco mode, then Eco+ (assuming you are not already in these modes).

Eventually you'll get to a point where the tank reads 'empty' (but it isn't) and turtle mode is engaged with your max power usage seriously curtailed.

For all of the above the range display will continue with it's vague estimates. Eventually your range hits zero and some point after that the battery indicator will light up, at this point your driving using whatever residual of battery that usually provides the 12 volt supply for electronics.

Fortunately the one time I did this I was yards away from my destination when the car switched to 12volt battery. Incidentally it estimated (and I presume took) 4hrs 40m to completely recharge from empty on a PodPoint Universal which I think has a max rating of 11kW (although whether the e-Up! uses that fully is another question).

When I first took delivery of the car (at my works car park) it had 1 mile range left as the dealership's driver had obviously driven it like an ICE all along the motorway from Chester to N.Staffs. Once I turned off the heater, radio and put it in Eco+ mode I managed the five mile drive home with the range showing zero for at least half of that.

In my experience the range is often optimistic for the first 3/4's of the tank and then pessimistic for the last 1/4 ...

The range indicator has only been increasing by about 10%, even switching to the full ""eco+"" mode, so I have been thinking the benefit rather marginal. But in cold weather it seems to make a much bigger difference as even the intermediate stage ""eco"" mode is much more miserly with the heater. We went to the sports centre for our usual session this morning which is three miles round trip on the road. I normally expect it to drop the range estimate by twice that amount. But this morning in ""eco"" mode I got back with only 1 mile range used up! Probably another false dawn but I thought I'd share while I'm still feeling good about it.

2956,0,2015-03-03,"Full press release text below, verbatim from VW:

Volkswagen is presenting the Sport Coupé Concept GTE in a world premiere at the 2015 Geneva International Motor Show and is presenting this avant-garde model as the champion of a new, progressive Volkswagen design language. ""Evolution and revolution come together in the Sport Coupé Concept GTE. 

This concept is based on Volkswagen design DNA, which has been visibly sharpened even more. It shows how fascinating the highest-volume brand of our Group is shaping the immediate future,"" says Walter de Silva, Head of Design of Volkswagen AG. Dr Heinz- Jakob Neußer, Volkswagen Brand Board Member for Development, explains: ""This concept car is a breathtakingly dynamic coupé unlike any other to appear in this class. In the design of the Sport Coupé Concept GTE – that is, in the style of an exclusive sports car that is enriched by the added functionality of a large boot lid and the interior space of a four-seater – we see an impressive alternative to the classic saloons of the B and C segments."" Klaus Bischoff, Head of Design of the Volkswagen Brand, adds this: ""The Sport Coupé Concept GTE is another milestone of expressive design. Unmistakably reinvented, from the first to the last stroke. A stylistic compass. In this concept car, Volkswagen is not only presenting the new design of a new model, but also initial glimpses of a new design era.""

High-end interface. The interior of the Sport Coupé Concept GTE is as innovative as its exterior. The extremely clean design, ergonomic perfection and new interactive interfaces between human and machine – including the use of the driver's biometric data and a new Active Info Display with 3D look – combine to create an avant-garde atmosphere inside this coupé that is in complete harmony with its expressive exterior design.

GTE, the plug-in hybrid from Volkswagen. Not only is the car's design innovative, its technology is as well. The GTE designation promises revolutionary drive system technology. Ever since the Golf GTE made its debut, these three letters have been used at Volkswagen to designate a car with a plug-in hybrid drive. The Passat GTE follows this year. These cars can be driven approximately 50 kilometres in an all-electric mode; and yet they can cover very long distances with confidence. This all happens with maximum dynamics; the vehicles are silent gliders, powerful cruisers. GTE versions are conceivable in all vehicle classes, such as in the SUV concept vehicle that was shown at the North American International Auto Show in Detroit. In the Sport Coupé Concept GTE being revealed in Geneva, Volkswagen is adding a new facet to its GTE philosophy – a special avant-garde facet. The 279 kW / 380 PS GTE fastback delivers the long-distance properties of a Gran Turismo while simultaneously enabling zero-emission driving – thanks to its two electric motors and externally chargeable battery. The concept car, with a top speed of 250 km/h, has an average combined fuel consumption of 2.0 l/100 km.

Its own class. Volkswagen differentiates between the B, C and D segments in the mid-size and premium classes. The latest Passat, for example, is setting standards in the mid-class, i.e. in the high- volume section of the B segment; the Volkswagen CC is positioned in the upper B segment; and the Phaeton, as a premium saloon, is a typical D segment model. The concept car being presented in Geneva is now breaking out of the upper B segment and into the C segment. Klaus Bischoff once again: ""Internally, the Sport Coupé Concept GTE is a car that we position above today's Volkswagen CC. We are enriching this segment with a premium design which is as exclusive as it is dynamic, and which casts the term avant-garde in a new light."" The Head of Volkswagen Design continues: ""In developing the concept we had a specific goal in mind: This four-door sports car should be desirable; it should elicit an ""I want to have it"" feeling.

Fast proportions. The engineering basis for the charismatic design of the Sport Coupé Concept GTE is once again provided by the modular transverse matrix (MQB) from Volkswagen. It makes it possible to implement fascinating proportions and ideal package dimensions. The most important of all of these dimensions is the ratio of the exterior length to the wheelbase. The concept car is 4,870 mm long, while the wheelbase measures a phenomenal 2,841 mm. This creates a very comfortable interior length of 1,871 mm and extremely concise body overhangs. The front overhang is 909 mm, and the rear 1,120 mm – each measured from the centre of the axle. At the same time, in this concept car Volkswagen has put a very low (1,407 mm high) and wide (1,865 mm) four-door coupé on large 21- inch wheels. Thanks to the MQB, the use of space in the vehicle is, as implied, excellent: Despite its dynamic dimensions, the Sport Coupé Concept GTE – which is fitted with a panoramic sliding sunroof – offers impressive front and rear headroom, for instance. The large boot lid – which cannot be recognised as such from outside – gives access to a 480-litre boot. Avant-garde without limits!

Exterior design 

Charismatic Volkswagen. The Sport Coupé Concept GTE with its avant-garde appearance is taking the automotive world by storm. If it were to go into production, the four-door sports car would be attractive in price for people who need a car with more than two doors and enjoy perfected design. To develop a design statement like the Sport Coupé Concept GTE as an affordable dream all the way to production readiness is a challenge. But by developing the modular transverse matrix and a highly unique design DNA, Volkswagen has created all of the right conditions for taking this milestone car and turning it into a production car over the mid-term future. ""Our entire know-how, a maximum of creativity, is bundled in the expressive design of the Sport Coupé Concept GTE,"" says Klaus Bischoff. The chief designer continues: ""A four-door coupé with the charismatic design of a sports car – this car occupies new territory and shows how many rich facets can be expressed by our new design language."" Design details of the Sport Coupé Concept GTE:

Front end – radiator grille and headlights merge. In the Sport Coupé Concept GTE, the radiator grille, headlights and VW badge merge into a completely new interpretation of the Volkswagen front end more than ever before. The designers specifically emphasised three-dimensionality in its design and thereby created a body structure that projects an incomparably independent and extremely dynamic image. Towards its outer edges, the radiator grille unit borders the LED dual headlights that are deeply embedded and integrated into the front end. Each of them is framed by a radiator grille cross piece made of aluminium, whose ends take an upward turn – like the wing tips (winglets) of a modern jet aeroplane. The form of these winglets is repeated at various points of the exterior and interior, running as a common thread throughout the vehicle's design.


Distinctive light design. In the case of the radiator grille, the uppermost cross piece with its winglets frames the inner LED modules (main beam & dot-pattern daytime running lights); the second cross piece wraps around the outer LED modules (dipped beam light & dot-pattern daytime running lights). The winglets also function as daytime running lights thanks to integrated bands of LEDs; the corresponding section of the upper cross piece also performs the turn indicator functionality by alternating its LED colour. The daytime running light signature of the Sport Coupé Concept GTE is completed by the C-shaped LED modules arranged around the lower air intakes (an identifying characteristic of electric and plug-in hybrid models from Volkswagen).


Six cross pieces for the radiator grille. Beneath the two upper radiator grille cross pieces, which extend across nearly the entire width of the front end, four other aluminium trim pieces follow. Each trim piece is narrower than the one above it, and together they form a wide ""V"" that is framed by body-coloured area of the bumper. To the right and left of this, the distinctive C-shaped signature of the daytime running lights are eye-catching.

Silhouette. The Sport Coupé Concept GTE is not a saloon; it is really a coupé with four doors and a boot lid. This approach led to a design that emphasises long, extended lines, a low overall height and an athletic body form. Just how uncompromisingly this conceptual philosophy was implemented can be clearly seen in the car's silhouette: the roofline assumes the shape of a flattened curve extending from the A-pillar that is set far back (resulting in a very long bonnet) into the rear body. Dominating the rear part of the silhouette is the extremely low-set C-pillar, which develops seamlessly from the roofline. Fine details on the sides: air exhaust vent openings were integrated in the front wings and doors (and similarly in the bonnet); their chrome elements reiterate the stylistic theme of the winglets. Look further and they are also reflected in the 21-inch five-spoke wheels.


Side line and bonnet become one. Just how precisely the design of the concept car was created and executed is illustrated by two examples in the car's silhouette. First, there is the line of the window sill. This line, which looks as though it were carved into the body is continued as a sharp edge into the wings, where it then merges into the winglet of the upper radiator grille cross piece and serves as the termination point of the four lower chrome trim strips in the radiator grille. Second, there is the character line. It runs below the window sill and is the most important line on the vehicle. At the rear, it is designed as what is known as an undercut. Here, the character line is drawn slightly outward; this is how the designers emphasise the strong shoulder section and generate a light-refracting edge. This undercut reduces gradually as it runs towards the front of the car. Here the character line extends into the front wheel arch. At the same time, it develops into the edge of the large bonnet, which even includes the front wings and the upper area of the wheel arches. When the bonnet is opened, the picture is one familiar from motorsport; in many sports cars, when the bonnet is opened, nearly the entire engine area is revealed. A pretty detail: fully recessed door handles.

Rear section. The precision and attention to detail that went into the design of the Sport Coupé Concept GTE is illustrated well by a look at the side of the rear section. Here it can be seen that the roof line, including the line of the C-pillars – which projects an imaginary line through to the trailing edge of the boot lid – transitions directly into the vertical surface of the rear section. This is a stylistic characteristic of classic sports cars. The trailing edge, or rear spoiler, respectively, visually lengthens the car; laterally, the lower edge of the rear spoiler is continued above the rear lights and directly into the character line, and in this way it also extends into the shoulder section. It is the expressive image of a classic sports car that lends the four-door car its unique charisma here. The roof section tapers from front to rear, and this inward tapering creates space for a muscular shoulder section, which in turn transitions into the powerfully flared and uniform surfaces of the integrated wheel arches below the undercut of the character line. A sports car simply must look like this.


Rear lights. Like the headlights, the trapezoidal LED rear lights are designed with a 3D look; their light signature repeats the theme of the winglets. On each side of the vehicle, the basic lighting unit consists of two glossy black elements, in which the LEDs of the brake light as well as reflectors and LED glass inserts (for the rear lights and indicators) have been integrated. The red covers of the rear lights were executed in a three- dimensional design. At night, the black background surfaces of the basic lighting unit are not visible. This makes the illuminated LED elements appear to hover, and they create an unmistakable light signature.

Interior concept 

Active Info Display with 3D visuality. The new interface modules of the Sport Coupé Concept GTE are appealing to the eye and a high-tech pleasure. The instrument cluster is a prototype of a newly conceptualised Active Info Display with 3D visual effect. The display has a 12.3-inch diagonal and was designed in such a way that the virtual space blends into the real border of the instrument cluster – this is done by a patented ambient light with a three-dimensional effect. No bordered black panel is visible, rather one sees a free- form surface, which interactively structures the three-dimensional space without perceptible borders. This attains a previously unknown high level of value. In its basic configuration, the digital instrument depicts two round instruments; on the left there is the power meter, on the right the speedometer, and in the middle a field to which a wide variety of information can be assigned for display. The new free-form surface makes the round instruments appear to hover in virtual space. The graphics of the displays change according to the driving mode (E-mode or GTE mode).

Four displays. The touchscreen of the central infotainment system has a 10.1 inch diagonal; the area alongside this touchscreen also features sensitive sliders for climate control. Serving as the media control module for the rear seating area is a touchscreen (12.3 inch) that is integrated between the individual seats. It can be used to operate functions including the media library, telephone and navigation. Rear passengers can also control the two screens embedded in the backrests of the front seats (each 10.1 inch) via this media control unit. In addition, the sliders integrated alongside the 12.3-inch display can be used to operate the automatic climate control system (four-zone climate control).

Navigation recognises biometric data. For the first time, Volkswagen is interfacing the car's electronics directly with the driver. Based on the driver's biometric data, the Sport Coupé Concept GTE determines – via a smartwatch or armband for measuring the driver's vital functions – whether to select a route leading to the destination that includes an ambitious and winding country road or a gentle route instead. Monitoring of biometric data begins as soon as the driver inputs the destination by speech control or on the touchscreen – but naturally, only if the driver wants to this data stored in the device be used as input for the navigation system. Time and distance are secondary factors here. In this navigation mode, which is individually tailored to the driver, the sole purpose is to experience maximum driving enjoyment. The navigation system recommends routes for this. The recommendations are displayed in lists or via Cover Flow; in this case, apps are used to show additional information and images of the individual routes, e.g. from Instagram. The driver can view the selected route in the infotainment system before heading out. Simultaneously, the driver gets detailed information on the type of route and on the traffic, weather and road conditions along the route. To get the most precise real-time information, the system evaluates the anonymised data (car-to-car) of other vehicles that are already driving on the same route ahead of the Sport Coupé Concept GTE. At the same time, the system compares route conditions to the vehicle state and its equipment. So, before the start, the Sport Coupé Concept GTE checks the vitality of the driver, the route conditions and itself.

Cocoon feeling. The way in which a line from the dash panel and door shoulders appears to wrap around the four passengers like a cocoon is unique. The dash panel, designed with horizontal elements and leather-trimmed at the top, uniformly transitions into the front door trim panels. In turn, the look of these panels is continued – both stylistically and in material selection – into the rear doors. From there, this cocoon element that surrounds the entire interior extends up to the interior trim beneath the rear window.

Iconic, cleanly structured dash panel. The dash panel is designed straightforward, clean and minimalistic. In the upper area, three slender and elegant aluminium slots function as ventilation openings. Beneath them runs a slender accent strip with a black piano paint finish. Another aluminium ventilation slot follows beneath the accent strip. It spans the entire width of the dash panel, and is only interrupted by the main instrument – the Active Info Display. Another aluminium trim strip that runs across the entire width completes the decor. It is stylistically continued into the door panels where it is transformed into the door handle as a ""wing"". Another distinctive line is formed by the ambient lighting. The precise, thin line of light – with its variable colours – wraps around the dash panel (and into the front door panels), the central infotainment system and the centre console that extends into the rear seating area and thereby emphasises the contours in these areas.

Sports car centre console. The centre console rises towards the dash panel, like in a sports car, where it meets the infotainment system. Here too, elegant gloss-black and very thin aluminium surrounds are dominant styling elements. Forming a contrast to this, beneath the ""hovering"" design of the centre console, is a level that has the look of natural wood. The same material is found on the door panels and on the steering wheel. Practical details: to the right of the DSG gear knob are cupholders; cups placed in them can be kept warm or cooled. The gear selector lever for the 6-speed DSG is equipped with a shift-by-wire gear-shifting logic. Like a joystick, it normally remains in a central middle position. The R, N and D gear selections are activated by a short kick. The driver selects the P position by pushing a separate button that is integrated in the gear selector lever.

Drive system 

Plug-in hybrid drive. The Sport Coupé Concept GTE is powered by a plug-in hybrid drive system that is both economical and sporty. The combustion engine Volkswagen is using in the concept car is a turbocharged 3.0-litre six-cylinder direct-injection engine (TSI) that produces 220 kW / 299 PS of power and a maximum torque of 500 Nm. The electrical components consist of a lithium-ion battery (in the centre tunnel) and two electric motors – the front electric motor is integrated in the gearbox case of the 6-speed DSG (DQ400E), and it outputs 40 kW; the rear electric motor develops 85 kW of power. The total available system power is 279 kW / 380 PS. If necessary, the system drive power can be distributed to all four wheels thanks to the rear electric motor and an ""electric propshaft"". In sporty GTE mode, the coupé, with a top speed of 250 km/h, accelerates to 100 km/h in just 5.0 seconds. Despite this dynamic performance, the concept car is a frontrunner in fuel economy. Its combined fuel consumption is just 2.0 l/100 km. In addition, the Sport Coupé Concept GTE can be driven all-electrically for a distance of at least 50 kilometres – and therefore with zero emissions. The total driving range of the concept car is over 1,200 km.

""Hybrid"". The concept car starts by default in Hybrid mode. The Sport Coupé Concept GTE is a classic full hybrid, which charges its battery via regenerative braking and automatically utilises the right combination of TSI and/or electric motors according to the specific drive situation. As soon as the driver releases the accelerator pedal, and the battery is sufficiently charged, all drive sources are shut off and decoupled from the drivetrain. This is a special form of ""coasting"". Zero emissions are produced in this mode. If the driver releases the accelerator pedal or brakes, and the battery is insufficiently charged, the two electric motors operate as generators and feed the energy recovered from braking into the lithium-ion battery. In this case, the TSI is also shut off and decoupled. When the V6 engine is the sole source of propulsion, the concept car is a pure front-wheel drive car. Thanks to the efficient technologies of the car's TSI engine the Sport Coupé Concept GTE is still very fuel- efficient, even in this drive mode.

""E-Mode"". In E-mode, which the driver activates by button push, only the 85 kW electric motor at the rear axle provides propulsive power. In all-electric driving, the V6 TSI is decoupled from the drivetrain by disengaging the clutch, and it is shut off. As soon as the six-cylinder engine needs to be used again – due to the battery's charge state or other parameters – it is coupled to the drivetrain again within fractions of a second without any jolts. The lithium-ion battery, which has a capacity of 10.7 kWh, is responsible for supplying energy to the electric motors. The power electronics integrated in the front engine compartment manage the flow of high- voltage electricity to and from the battery and the electric motors. The vehicle's 12-Volt electrical system is supplied with electricity via a DC/DC converter. The battery is charged from external electrical sources or while driving.

""GTE"". The driver presses the GTE button to switch to GTE mode, which activates a very dynamic side of the coupé. The accelerator pedal, gearbox and steering characteristics are now even sportier. In GTE mode, the TSI and electric motors also work together in 'boosting' which calls up the full system power and maximum system torque.

Battery Charge / Battery Hold. The dual mode Battery Hold (battery's energy content is kept constant) or Battery Charge (battery is charged while driving) is activated from a submenu of the infotainment system. This mode might be used to intentionally enable all-electric E-mode at an urban destination in order to drive with zero emissions there.

All-wheel drive thanks to ""electric propshaft"". As soon as the situation requires it, all four wheels of the Sport Coupé Concept GTE are driven. In this case (and if battery charge is low), the front electric motor – which is now being supplied with kinetic energy via the V6 TSI – acts solely as a generator and a source of electricity for its counterpart at the rear axle. Since the energy for driving the rear axle flows by wire and not mechanically here, this is referred to as an ""electric propshaft"". Because the TSI drives the rear electric motor via the front electric motor, the all-wheel drive system also operates when the battery's charge state is low.

How would you do that on a switched off car? The largest consumer in this case I would expect to be the alarm? Can you lock the car without enabling the alarm?"
1215,0,2018-12-23,"...

There's a big reason for going to a User Interface (UI) that uses a touch screen. It is the same reason that the iPhone whooped (eventually) the Blackberry. You can define controls based on context, they are flexible, you can change and expand them, they can be customised by the user. And, before someone else points it out, it is easier for the OEM - in that they only have to plan in a screen in the dash area and provide power and comms to it. If they had buttons to add in then they would be fixed and each button needs comms.

I would expect that as the VW ID develops that a software-defined UI would be enhanced as new software updates add (and yes will remove) features. Then just think about the additions of gestures, voice control. But I am not quite thinking about Firefox (the film with Clint Eastwood not the browser). 

The Machine Learning aspects that we see in increasing autonomy can be used for simpler things like setting favourite radio stations, navigating to nearest charging point, getting live status of the charging point, turning on the rear screen heater, making payments (eg parking, tolls), etc.."
684,0,2020-08-04,"I'm currently struggling with the VW apps.

If the actual car software were to be written by the same team as that for the apps, then my car would only go backwards and would electrocute the occupants when the brake pedal was pressed: Or is it me who cannot manage my own expectations?

What was particularly worrying was the Car-Net technical support. They are currently operating with no working diagnostic or management tools whatsoever. So they only have a vague idea that the system is up or down. They have no working tools to check registrations, monitor data or trace the communication between car and service. Their entire admin system has been down for weeks and have no idea when it will be back up. Basically they are administering it blind and hoping nothing goes badly wrong. And this is ultimately a customer chargeable option. Shameful!

So I got strung along and told not to re-register the car otherwise when they eventually manage to get the admin system up, they will not be able to view the historical data or if the registration failed then it would be totally screwed with no way to fix it.

I eventually got tired of the endless ""no idea when the admin system will be back up"" response, so I deleted and re-registered the car again and about 24 hours later it all came back online.

Basically, whoever is running this service just needs sacking and proper management brought in. As a minimum there should be:

1. A customer facing status page showing which parts of the service are up.
2. A planned maintenance page showing which services are expected to be up and down and when
3. Proper training for front line support staff to understand the Car-Net architecture
4. Front line support diagnostic tools to manage registrations and fix common issues
5. Dedicated Car-Net technical support that communicate directly with the customer to resolve deeper issues.
6. Planned management, development and migration of the Car-Net back-end services"

1815,0,2018-02-05,"Hi Steve

I think we're both on the same assumptions which reflects the problem being isolated to the car itself. 
I would be very surprised if the App had a way of awakening the car as this would be a security risk which potentially could be devastating. I could be wrong here, but that's my gut feeling. On the other hand I do believe that the Car-Net servers have a part in the problem as well. If they're unavailable, they are a source of error as well.

My frustration concerns the fact that so many users are experiencing the same problems. To my knowledge VW are aware of the problem, but when will a solution be available? One of the reasons I bought the car was to be able to control features through the app. Living in a cold climate I depend on the availability to pre-heat the car at my convenience.

Another frustration is that my VW dealer (whom I know pretty well) tells me that they have no information whatsoever in regards to Car-Net. He also told me that they have not received any training. Given my background he said that I most probably know more about Car-Net than they do. I mean seriously? Is that your experience as well?

I can settle with the fact that the service is faulty, sure. But someone needs to step up and take responsibility and present a permanent working solution. 

Keep us posted on your progress, very interesting to follow.

1814,0,2018-02-05,"Hi Nicklas

This is similar to my assumptions, though through trial and error and not technical tests. I found my car was connected after parking in the evening, I could refresh the app, change departure times, turn on heating etc. But in the morning the connection was dead. When I opened the car, turned on ignition, turned off and locked the connection resumed. I used this theory with the dealer on the last visit saying there appears to be a time limit to the connection and then it times out. Will remain dead until re-awoken. The app appears not to be able to reawaken the car by itself. I think this is one issue as you have mentioned too. There is also the issue of limited capability to connect to the data network which increases its chances of not being able to receive commands or send the refresh. But I may be wrong on this if the first issue is true?

Update on todays dealer visit. VW are retaining my car for additional day(s) to run a long list of diagnostics. Awaiting loan car.

I am not sealioning, you chose to make the assertion that I know nothing about the demands on pilots, which is somewhat true and somewhat not. I made assertions I think are obvious even to lay people. In regards the last point, I was discussing how the pilot/driver comes into meeting other traffic, clearly in a car the response is to manipulate speed and direction. This is not essential in a 'plane through acceleration braking and steering. I am sorry my embellishment offended your thought process!

I'm sorry but this is flat out plain and simple;-
1) touch screens require taking eyes off the road in a way that button controls don't. For that reason, touch screens are more dangerous than buttons, assuming equal levels of care and attention is put into their design. (of course, buttons can be designed badly and screens well, but the safest would be well-designed button/knob interface)
2) aeroplanes can fly straight and level with constant power and constant 'steering' angle for long periods of time, permitting periods of 'safe' eyes-off-road. The ONLY time I have EVER experienced that in a car for more than 30 seconds at a time was driving into Miami along Route 41, 25 years ago.

Heck, you can fly a 'plane in zero visibility if the circumstances allow! I don't see any meaningful comparison with road cars."

He was as puzzled as everyone else at first. However he was also the guy who had worked on it previously when they thought it might be due to suspension noise. Apparently the Golf has been running on the same components for the last few versions, going way back a decade or so. VW service personnel have found that they can optimise their imperfections by careful selection of lubrication, and that is what they tried with mine originally when they thought they had fixed it. As to the power steering theory he poured cold water on that as the early cars where it was supposed to be involved had hydraulic systems while the last few versions have used an electromechanical system. 

However he then suddenly remembered a technical bulletin he had seen recently. It supposedly did not apply to my car but he thought it might be relevant, whereby some Golfs had been experiencing noise in their differential systems because the wrong oil had been applied during manufacture (it is designed to last for the lifetime of the car). He said that he thought that this might fix it. This will happen in a week or two, when I will report back."

And indeed for all conventionally fueled vehicles, as well.

There are two separate issues being discussed in this thread. The first is that the van will only charge at 3.6kW on single phase. This is a known issue, VW have got this wrong before with other vehicles. It was advertised incorrectly in the UK, and if you don't like it, reject the vehicle. You have every right to do so, you have been mis-sold. 

The second is range. The key thing to understand here is that you don't charge up in miles - you put energy into the battery, measured in kWh. The range shown is an estimate based on that energy capacity and the vehicle's consumption. The low ranges indicated are a result of high consumption. To confirm this, look at your average consumption in kWh/100 miles, or whatever your favoured units are, and calculate the energy required to go for the distance indicated by the vehicle's GOM at full charge. It will be approximately the stated useable battery capacity. If it's way less, you have a battery fault. But in 99.9% of cases, it won't be. It's consumption due to driving style, load, heater use etc. Sorry, but that's the way it is. 

Hope this helps!"

1975,0,2017-11-07,"My GTE had developed a front suspension ""groan"" when backing off the drive on full lock and also when slowly mounting & dismounting the rubber speed bumps in our village. 
The noise appeared to be MORE evident on the drivers side of the car, but the passengers side could also be heard groaning to a lesser degree ( maybe given the distance away from the driver ). 
I mentioned the issue to the senior tech prior to my car going in for its two year service a few months ago, he told me that on previous occasions they had replaced the top strut mountings on a few cars and also a couple of drop link assembles. But just recently, VW had put out a service bulletin to advise that the following process should be carried out on any Mk 7 Golf's for customers complaining of groaning noise from the front suspension of there cars. This procedure has to be carried out PRIOR to replacing ANY components on the car under a warranty claim.
The recommendation is to remove the front lower rear retaining bolt from the bottom arm / sub frame and VW has provided a special grease to lubricate in between both parts of the large bushing assembly and then the bottom link is reassembled. 
This process is to be carried out on BOTH sides of the car.
Any warranty claims submitted for the replacement cost for both front suspension components & labour, would be rejected by VW if service bulletin has not been completed FIRST !.
I have to say I was not really convinced that this suggestion would rectify the noise and that I would be returning the car once again for the same problem after the work had been carried out !.
Because I had been living with this groaning noise for almost the last 7 - 9 months, it was not going to be long before I could hear the noise again if it had not been fixed !.
At the dealership, they have some small speed bumps at the side of showroom to protect the customers from the cars that are passing a badly placed side door, very dangerous if you are in silent electric mode !.
When I arrived at the dealership, you could clearly hear the groaning noise as the car mounted the bumps, but after the work had been carried out and I left the dealership, the noise had appeared to have gone !.
Not wanting to build my hopes up to far, I passed no comment with regards to a fix for a few days.
The car was serviced approx 6 - 8 weeks ago now and to-date I have NOT heard any more of that groaning noise !!!. When the work on the car was in progress, I received a ""health check"" video ( which is now the norm on most cars ) but the senior tech actually focused the camera on both sides of the car and made a point of ""zooming in"" on the recently applied grease to the bushes, nice touch !.
As you all know, any strange noises entering into the cabin are very EASY to detect when you are in the silent electric mode, a lot harder to spot and locate when you have to listen to the ICE doing its work !. 
I am not saying that this is same problem that you have, but VW must have had many many complaints and received many warranty claims for parts & labour for this type of issue on the Mk 7 Golfs,which in turn has resulted into an investigation and hopefully a long term fix for future deliveries. 
A simple fix for the lack of 50p worth of grease at the time of assembly of the car maybe !."
1160,0,2018-12-22,"I had a view tonight of the FullyCharged YouTube video test drive. I have a super sharp large screen 4K TV and there were a few things that I was able to spot whilst watching the video. Firstly,there were no direct pictures of the dashboard but the VW engineer stated they were working on a HUD display. Now, due to my TV’s high resolution I could see colour reflection’s in both Robert’s and the VW engineer’s glasses with them sitting in the front seats. Either this was the dash ipad style displays refecting or possibly something much brighter and larger from the front of the inner windscreen. Robert did hint to the fact that he had seen something that he had never seen before. I wonder if the HUD was projecting a giant multicolour image onto the inner screen.

I also noticed what looked like grey leather front seats and I also noted the high quality of all the surrounding cockpit trim which looked remarkably production ready. I also spotted that there was a neat small yellow repeater light built into the drivers external mirror, it was either a turn indicator light or a blind spot trigger. I could also make out that the rear tail lamps looked remarkably similar to the concept car but a tad bigger. Not sure why there were air ducting vents on the lower front bumper, the concept had a much smoother front end.

All in all an interesting video. I had a chat with my local VW dealer a few days ago and they stated that I would be able to place a deposit during next March. My hunch is the car might be launched at the Geneva motor show with possibly production starting a lot earlier than was alluded to in the video( 2020 ). We shall see !."

It gives me 5MWH/year but really 4MWH/year usable as the energy is not distributed evenly throughout day/night and winter/summer. Say a solar system lasts 30 years that´s 30 x 4MWH = 120MWH.

So 120MWH for £6000 that´s 120KWH for £6 that´s 5p per KWH (and so far I´ve charged 93% at home).

Granted, I am in a hot location, in the UK it´s more like usable 2MWH/year and 10p per KWH.

Of course, you have to have your car parked at home on a number of days per week to see those numbers since otherwise the needed extra batteries might bring you to nearer 15p/kWH.

And you have to be able to pay for all the money up front which is obviously not as good.

Would be rather like if you had to pay £6000 the first time you went to the petrol station and thereafter it was free for 30 years. Although of course with petrol it would probably be more like £20-30,000 for 30 years petrol.

Or perhaps a better analogy would be if you could pay to have a petrol pump installed in your garden and therefore you had free (but not unlimited) petrol for 30 years.

So solar is another way to get (eventually after pay back) cheaper energy which you can´t do with a petrol/diesel car."

Apart from having the option of decent sports seats (leather heated), lane keeping, dynamic lights and a sunroof the GTE doesn't come with RANGE ANXIETY!

So maybe maybe up to 10% at each end. 

However with your calculations the difference is 32%, much higher than most peoples expectations. Some of the difference will be other electrical loads (did you have A/C on?, wipers? lights? etc), but even after that there still seems some unexplained missing electrons!

OpenChargeMap also do their own app which is an alternative.

Polar and CYC will cover a large majority of the public charging points where I am in the South West. I would also suggest downloading the Pod-Point app which gives you access to a good number of other chargers, some of which are in Park and ride facilities.

At least they have remained consistent on this. 70% @8yr/100k was what VW stated to me in 2014 when I was nailing down the specifics on the e-up!

FWIW I might as well post what their reply was to some of my questions about the e-up!;-

2) The 8 year guarantee on the battery applies only under the provision that after a period of 8 years with a maximum mileage of
100,000 miles, the battery still has at least 70% of its capacity.

3) The battery is a Lithium - Nickel - Manganese Cobalt Oxide (NMC).

4) The vehicle comes as standard with two leads a conventional AC 3 pin mains charging and a cable for public charging points.

5) Battery capacity = 50Ah.
Rated Voltage = 374V.
Rated Power = 75kW peak, 35kW constant.
Rated Energy = 18.7kWh.

6) The heating is supplied by a high voltage heater element.

7) The motor type is a permanent magnet.

8) The battery has no active cooling system.

9) These vehicles do not creep, the drivers foot has to be off the accelerator and foot brake applied to bring the vehicle to a standstill.

10 The SDx value is 1.139 kg/2,09m2 = 544,98 kg/m2. The CDx value is 0.308

11) The braking system is discs on the front drums at the rear.

12) The recommended service interval inspection is after 30,000 km or 2 years and then every 30,000 km or 1 year. I have been unable to confirm the cost of a service at this stage, however I have forwarded this to our Factory colleagues and I hope to provide an answer when they return from their annual holidays at the beginning of September. [FWIW; they didn't]

13) Individual battery modules can be replaced, the cost for an individual battery module is £619.29 plus VAT and fitting.

14) To fully recharge a flat battery using the conventional 3 pin household mains socket cable takes approximately 6 - 8 hours. From a public charging point it takes approximately 5 -7 hours.

15) Maximum torque is delivered at 12,000 rpm. [I think they got mixed up here and that this is the maximum motor speed. Peak torque is usually from zero to some mid-range speed value.]

16) There is no spare wheel available option available for the e-up!"

Ah well spotted. I had got that mixed up the wrong way round in my head. (I have my GTE set to kWh/100km where lower is better). You are right that it makes no sense. I think we will have to wait for firm figures once the car is formally released as these figures don't seem quite believable.

2309,1,2017-02-23,"The manual mentions the following which might be helpful:

""Charging for the first time and charging after long standing periods
If the high-voltage battery is new or has not been charged for a long time, the maximum charge of the high-voltage battery will probably not be reached until after several charging cycles. This is for technical reasons and does not represent a vehicle malfunction. If it is generally not possible to fully charge the high-voltage battery, have the high-voltage battery checked in a qualified workshop.

If the vehicle is not used for a long period, the high-voltage battery must be charged after four months at the latest 
















NOTICE
If the vehicle is parked for a long period with a discharged high-voltage battery, irreversible damage can be caused to the high-voltage battery.

Always charge the high-voltage battery as soon as possible 
Automatic switch-off for electrical consumers
The intelligent vehicle electrical system automatically implements a range of measures to prevent the 12-volt battery from discharging under high loads:


The performance of large electrical consumers may be reduced or they may be switched off completely.

The supply of electricity to the 12-volt sockets and the cigarette lighter is interrupted temporarily while the electric drive is activated.
The vehicle electrical system cannot always prevent the 12-volt vehicle battery from discharging. For example when the ignition is switched on for an extended period with the engine off, or when the side or parking lights are on when the vehicle is parked for an extended period.""


I would conclude that with 4 weeks you are well withing the 4 month recommended limit so should not have major issues. As long as the 12V battery is fully charged and nothing left on you should be OK.

However if you come back to a flat battery the following section details how to get started again:

Jump starting








Introduction
This chapter contains information on the followingsubjects:
⇒ Jump lead connection point (positive battery terminal) 
⇒ Jump lead connection point (earth connection) 
⇒ How to activate the electric drive using jump leads 
If the hybrid drive fails to start because the 12-volt vehicle battery is flat, the discharged battery can be connected to the 12-volt battery of another vehicle to start the engine."

""Thank you for your email of 15 June posing several questions about charging the battery of your Volkswagen e-Golf. Please accept my apologies for the delay in responding.

Having liaised with our Technical Support Team, I am pleased to confirm the following:

Charging with Direct Current (fast charging) will not damage the battery if it’s done on a regular basis. It does not invalidate the Manufacturer’s Warranty on the battery, as long as the instructions in the Owner’s Manual are followed. The DC method is
capable of charging the battery to 80 per cent capacity in around 30 minutes. The other methods of charging (wall box) charge the battery to 100 per cent capacity.

The warning notice in the Owner’s Handbook on frequently charging the vehicle with a high charging power rapid charging, in particular with DC charging is notification that the battery will only ever be 80 per cent charged if the vehicle is only recharged with this method. Charging on a DC rapid charger more than three times in succession does not invalidate the Manufacturer’s Warranty on the battery.

The eight year High Voltage Battery Warranty is valid for eight years from the date of registration, or 99,360 miles (160,000 km) whichever comes first. Full details of this and the used car warranty can be found on the Volkswagen website:

Those codes were recorded during my visit on Sat 3rd Oct.

I'd driven up from Southampton intending to charge at Chieveley, Warwick & Trowell CCS stations en route back to Chesterfield.

Couldn't make the Chieveley CCS work after several attempts do plugged int adjacent 'Fast AC' (sic !) point. Whilst there a BMW arrived and used the CCS without problems. When he'd finished, I asked him to watch me and intervene if I did anything wrong but got exactly same error codes as before (with no errors spotted by BMW driver). At that point, I assumed the car must be faulty so amended route to go via 'Fast ACs' @ Oxford & Cherwell Valley then spent night at my sister's in Towcester (with a long 10A charge ).

Sunday morning I drove up to Leicester Forest OK intending to use Fast AC again but on a whim tried the CCS first. It worked perfectly ! As did the CCS @ Trowell. And as did both CCS machines at Woodall when I tried them a couple of days ago.

I couldn't contact Ecotricity until the Monday when they insisted that there must be a fault with my car - possibly some loose pins in the handshake circuit - but offered no explanation for that 'fault' magically healing itself @LF & Trowell 

I'm inclining to the belief that there is some sort of fault with the Chieveley CCS unit but that it only affects VWs and that for some seriously odd reason BMWs (maybe others) have a different handshake routine."

VOLKSWAGEN E-GOLF AND GTE EIGHT-YEAR BATTERY WARRANTY
1. A guarantee for eight years or 99,360 miles/160,000km (whichever is soonest), on all material or manufacturing defects.
2. Gradual reduction in battery capacity over times is integral to the nature of the component, and does not represent a defect under the terms of this guarantee, as long as the reduction in capacity is not in excess of the value specified for this vehicle in the owner’s manual.
3. The guarantee on high voltage batteries does not apply if the defect has been caused
by the battery not being used, handled or maintained as described in the owner’s manual. This applies in particular to charging the battery, such as not charging on the CSS (Rapid charge) function 3 times in a row. Please check the owner’s manual for more details.
4. With the exception of the warranty term, all warranty conditions stipulated by the Volkswagen retailer selling the vehicle (prerequisites, criteria for freedom from defects, exclusions, settlement of claims, entry into force and start of extended warranty term, scope of application etc.) also apply to the high voltage battery."

I am not expecting perfection; I'm expecting a reasonable service that every other dealer has managed to provide for the 7 or so cars I've ordered in past - and every single one of them was a significantly cheaper car than the e-Golf.

It is not unreasonable to expect the dealer to have an approximate idea of delivery/lead times at order time.

It is not unreasonable to expect that the dealer or VW know the process between ""placing an order"" and ""order is with the factory"". Why are these not the same thing? Some people posting here have been waiting over a month and it's still not with the factory - why can't VW explain what happens between these two events?

It is not unreasonable to expect the dealer or VW to give lead times *from order time* rather than some magical date (""when the order hits the factory"") that happens after some indeterminate time that apparently nobody, not even VW, understands.

I tried to order my car 6 months before I need it when lead times were supposed to be 14-16 weeks. That gave me 10-12 weeks more than needed. It took 4 weeks to place the order and has been another two since, yes the order is still not at the factory. The lead time has been increased to 20 weeks and VW now say that's *from when it hits the factory*. It's looking unlikely the car will arrive in the 26 weeks I allowed and given the lead times on other EVs not knowing if I'll have a car to get me to work in March is unreasonable. The whole thing is, IMO, a shambles. Placing an order for another car as a backup is the only sensible thing to do."

So:

You could damage the battery with more than two consecutive DC charges

2209,1,2017-06-14,"My advice is to check with an electrician that the outside socket has the correct size cable for running a large appliance like a car charger. They can also offer advice for the correct way to do this.

Some outside sockets are only designed for short duration low current loads like a mower or hedge trimmer, so might not have a beefy enough supply cable.

The cables in the EVSE are screwed into terminals and can be removed, however they need to be put back carefully due to the large currents they carry.

The EVSE will get warm, so the box should have ventilation. Being outside all the time you should check for damp/corrosion of the EVSE every so often.

Also, consider that when you're out and about you won't have your granny charger with you, so make sure you're not going too far without a plan b.

An alternative to this would be to get a proper car wall point fitted through the OLEV scheme and not only have faster charging, but also something that's guaranteed and properly rated for the job."

Gotcha! (well almost)

A quick look at the terms and they are not specific enough. Three times in a row can be argued in many different ways. Without further explanation you can put all sorts of interpretation on it and any ambiguity will be interpreted against the party responsible for drafting. Even if you take the most draconian and stupid which requires you to plug in and get some non-rapid charge before a third rapid connection it leaves itself open to the get outs that have already been expressed.

That said it does give a pointer as to where further clarification may be obtained. ""please check the owners manual for more details"". Without seeing the manual I'm not sure how specific this is but I doubt whether this would be such as to prevent you from making what after all is just a normal journey for a car.

Did the salesman not draw your attention to this (highly material) fact before the contract was concluded?

I'm sure that there are many less careful owners out there who will find out if this fries the battery and run a test case long before you have a worry."

The other method is to set up a charging location with an upper battery charge limit of 80%. Then use this for the departure time that you want. The car will charge to whatever you set the lower battery charge first. Then prepare the car for departure with 80% charge at your departure time.

I use this to charge my Golf GTE to 70 or 80% when I arrive home. Then have the car charged to 90 or 100% and warm for when I leave home next day. Trying not to leave the car fully charged or discharged for too long to look after the battery.

The guarantee does NOT apply if you have NOT charged 3 times in a row on a CCS.

What it should have read if it were to exclude charging 3 times is; ""This applies in particular to charging the battery such as  not  charging on the CSS (Rapid charge) function 3 times in a row.

So it could be read that you HAVE to charge 3 times in a row on a CCS. It doesn't appear to stipulate when or how often you have to charge on a CCS 3 times in a row.

2190,1,2017-07-20,"Previous issue solved, thanks for that.

Next (probably obvious) issue:

Background info:
I have my departure time set for 6.30am and charging current now at 10A. It's set up with the timings of off peak electricity (00:30 to 0700). It says usually around 3 hours 50 minutes until fully charged. Regardless of what time I plug it in 7, 8, 9 10pm it starts charging immediately. The timer light is on next to the charging port on the car. 

I'm expecting it to not start charging immediately when I plug it in, but wait until say 2.30am so it reaches full charge at/around 6.30am (departure time). Is this not how it works? The timer has worked in the past so not sure what I've done to change it. 

What do I need to do to get it back on to a timer so it only starts charging during off peak hours?"

I agree worth checking elsewhere. When I got my Rolec installed they fitted a separate unit with circuit breaker/isolater switch was included in the price. I also got a separate meter for the socket as it was one of the last to be on the old grant scheme which transmits usage to the government OLEV. The only thing I got charged extra for was for a longer length of armoured cable as I wanted to site the socket on the far side of the front door from the garage where the consumer unit was and bury the cable. That was only £20 extra.

I used the Bristol based L A Electrical who are an approved Rolec supplier and I would recommend them."

Hi,

I’ve 2 E Transporters and have been on to my local dealer since April regarding this issue! 
I collated a fair amount of data and sent copies of the brochure which stated 7.2kw charging and mentioned 5.5hrs to fully charge! Within 24hrs VW had removed this from their online brochure and stated ”charge Over night” lol

Both vans have had a software update and this has not resolved this charging issue. I am waiting to hear back from the local dealer who have agreed to pay out compensation due to the fact that I’m not able to fully charge within my low rate tariff!

I’ve also been talking to myEnergi as I have 2 of their Zappi chargers. They informed me that the E golf had the same issue (now resolved) and advised me to keep shouting as the more of us that shout the sooner VW will get an update sorted to resolve this issue.

2186,1,2017-07-13,"As I understand it the charger tests the circuit before initiating charging. It may be that it detects a problem in your wiring and is not allowing a higher rate.

Other possibility is that it is faulty - I am assuming you have one of the new type of 3 pin charger which has no way to change the voltage on the unit. It may be worth trying charging at a different socket to try and work this out.

Can I double check that you have also changed the voltage in the locations of any departure times that you are using? It is possible to set a different rate in each location set up which is different from the voltage in ""Basic settings""."

There are no settings in the van you literally have the charge point. Nothing like the golf or my i3 where you can set time of departure, preheating charge output etc. The van has nothing which I didn't anticipate but should have known as no mention of such settings in the brochure.

2210,1,2017-06-14,"Thanks @AtTheVan.

I was going to get a dedicated charge point but I have no spare ways in my consumer unit and was advised that as well as the standard £200 to install it there would be an additional £80 cost. Also I would need an isolator switch and my electricity supplier quote a charge of over £80 for that. So to get a dedicate charge point would cost over £360. With my usage the quicker charge time is not a particular benefit so hence came to the conclusion of building my own set up.

The electric socket was installed by an electrician who knew what I wanted to use it for so should be ok there.

Good point about the heat/ventilation I'll look into that when choosing my box.

I find it very bizarre that there isn't a manual DC-DC inverter override .. If you have HV power available, but a flat 12v support battery? Why oh why do you have to do old-style jump leads?? ... this is crazy and unnecessary!

Just an engine compartment (located) momentary shunt switch is all that is needed .. just to bring the DC-DC inverter on for a short time so the support battery is brought back to life. Maybe simpler, an automatic override should added to start DC-DC inverter once 230v is applied to charge port (and 12v is flat)!?"
2191,1,2017-07-21,"...

You need to adjust the ""Limit Battery Charge"" percentage setting in the Basic Settings section of e-Manager. This is designed to charge the car to a minimum level immediately. If set to 100% the whole battery will charge immediately. I keep mine set at 30% so I have a little charge if I need to run into town in the evening after work, but then do the bulk of my charging with a morning departure time so I have a warm conditioned battery when leaving for work.

If you want to leave all your charging to off peak set it to 0%."

Thanks for joining the thread. Your earlier attempts probably correspond to the period when ElecHighway admitted there was an incompatibility with VWs although they now claim that to have been fixed.

Your 5th Oct attempt was very close to mine of 3rd. Tim hasn't given an exact date for his visit but I think it would probably have been close.

2813,1,2015-07-08,"Just got another explanatory statement from VW Customer Service to the effect that, contrary to our assumptions, the e-Golf does not log usage of rapid versus slow chargers: 

""You asked if Car-Net will log details of the history of the battery charging methods used. Having liaised with our Technical Support Team, they have confirmed that the charging history is not recorded, only the current status of the battery.""

It seems therefore that any refusal of cover for a damaged battery caused by excessive rapid charging could only be made on the basis of VW's Technical Support Team's opinion."
572,1,2021-02-24,"Do you have a home charger as well?

I don't think it will do any real harm charging to 100% when it will only be at 100% for a relatively short time.

The setting you may be looking for is the minimum charge.

Provided there is a departure time set at some point in the future the car will charge to the minimum charge setting when you plug it in and then stop.

It will then complete the charge in time for your departure.

For example set a minimum charge of 80% and a departure time of 07:30 every Monday.

The car will charge to 100% at 07:30 on Monday. Every time you plug it in after that it will charge to 80%. Until the next Monday morning, when it will charge to 100% for 07:30."
2311,1,2017-02-24,"...

The control units for the high voltage system still run on 12v so without that there is no way of turning the charging system on for the 12v battery. Also even if you plug the high voltage charger into your car it will not turn on as it needs the charge rate info from the car and again if the 12v system is flat the control unit that tells the charger what to do cannot work. Hence why you have to jump start it, just remember you cannot jump start from a gte as it's got a good chance of melting your battery wiring and maybe even cause a fire!!!"

Once the 12v is up the system can initialise and take over the full 12v recovery .....

The 230v recovery idea is much more difficult (probably still doable) .. so maybe I prefer my simpler single switch solution!! "

First how would they monitor this. Is it stored in a black box somewhere?

Secondly how would heating be the factor. Assuming 'normal' driving conditions. You would CCS charge, then drive for about an hour (at least) then charge again. I would presume that the heat generated by charging would dissipate over the time you are driving. 

What about the chemical reactions going on? Is the reason?

The only way the plug/ socket should heat up is if they are old with tarnished contacts causing resistance .

Having had my car order delayed by a few months over summer (which was nobody's fault), this caveat would make me very nervous... the cynic in me wonders if VW would use this as a way to limit their tax absorption costs by delaying delivery."
2003,1,2017-10-20,"OK, so now we are down to what the Owners Manual says about charging, which as you will see below nowhere prohibits you from charging on rapids any particular number of times consecutively.

These are the precautions it lists:

An incorrect battery charging process, a failure to adhere to general safety procedures, the use of unsuitable or damaged sockets and charging cables, charging on an unsuitable electrical installation and improper handling of the high-voltage battery can cause short circuits, electric shocks, explosions, fire, serious burns, injuries and death.

Always adhere to the stipulated sequence of steps in order to avoid the risk of an electric shock and serious injuries caused by residual energy in the electrical storage system. Never disconnect the mains plug during the charging process.

The charging cable should only be connected to a socket that is protected from water, moisture and other liquids.

Only charge on properly installed, tested and undamaged power sockets as well as on a fault-free electrical installation. Have the sockets and electrical installation checked by qualified expert personnel at regular intervals. Never use unfamiliar sockets or electrical installations for charging.

Never use damaged charging connectors and charging cables. Check charging connectors and cables for damage before use.

Never modify or repair electrical components in particular those in the high-voltage system.

Use only supplied charging cables or the charging station cable. If you need a replacement, we recommend only using Volkswagen charging cables.

Components of the charging cable can cause sparks and thus ignite flammable or explosive vapours. Never charge in locations where there is a risk of explosions.

Never use the charging cable together with an extension cable, a cable reel, a multiple socket outlet or an adapter such as a regional adapter or timer.

Always protect electrical connectors from water, moisture and other liquids.

For safety reasons, no other work should be carried out in or on the vehicle during the charging process.

Always end the charging process before disconnecting the mains plug.

Always remove the charging cable, fit the charging socket cap and close the charging socket flap before starting the vehicle
Information on charging:

Depending on the vehicle model, the vehicle can be charged with an alternating current or with a direct current. The duration of the charging process depends on the charge level of the high-voltage battery and the charger used. Fluctuations in mains voltage can lead to changes in the charging time required. Charging normally takes longest when the mains charging cable is used, in particular with a reduced charging current → Using the charging cable  . Charging may take much longer when the connected mains charging cable is exposed to direct sunlight. The charging socket is located behind a flap at the rear right of the vehicle → Exterior views  .​
The vehicle is equipped so that it can be charged with all alternating current chargers that have a compatible connector or a compatible socket. Always read the operating manual for charging stations or other charging facilities.

Charge the vehicle mainly with low charging power, in particular on a home charging station or with the supplied mains charging cable  →







 .

It generally advantageous to connect the vehicle to the electricity mains via a charging cable even when the high-voltage battery is fully charged. For example, the vehicle interior can be cooled or heated while it is stationary, the 12-volt vehicle battery can be charged and further electrical consumers in the vehicle can be operated via the charging cable.

Depending on the vehicle, there are the following possibilities to charge the high-voltage battery:

Charging with an alternating current (AC charging)
Use the charging socket → Fig. 135  A: ③ or B: ④ on the vehicle to charge with an alternating current. Charging with an alternating current can either be started immediately or at a set time by programming a departure time → Immediate charging and timer-controlled charging  using the charging buttons ②. The vehicle can be charged with an alternating current as follows.


Charging with the charging cable connected to a mains socket: the supplied charging cable for mains sockets → Fig. 136 A is kept in the vehicle → Stowage area  . The high-voltage battery is charged with a charging power of up to 2.3 kW. To charge the high-voltage battery, the mains connector on the supplied charging cable needs to be inserted into a mains socket. Before connecting the charging cable to the vehicle, observe information on usage and set the maximum permitted charging current on the respective socket → Using the charging cable  .

Charging on a charging station: the charging process is carried out via a fitted charging cable or a separate charging cable specially configured for charging on charging stations → Fig. 136 B. The high-voltage battery is charged with a charging power of up to 3.6 kW. You cannot carry out timer-controlled charging at all charging stations → Immediate charging and timer-controlled charging  . Charging on a home-charging station (wall box): the high-voltage battery can be charged on a fixed home-charging station (wall box) at up to 3.6 kW. This wall box is available as an accessory. A Volkswagen dealership will provide information on the home-charging station. Make sure that the home-charging station is installed by qualified expert personnel and that your house's electrical installation is also checked. Have the electrical installation regularly checked by expert personnel. Read the operating manual for the device about charging with a home-charging station. Observe the procedure for charging with an alternating current → Charging with an alternating current (AC charging)  .
Charging with a direct current (DC charging)
When charging with a direct current, the charging time can be considerably shorter than when charging with an alternating current. Therefore charging a factory-fitted high-voltage battery to 80% of the charge level with a direct current and a charging power of 40 kW will take about 0.5 hours. The high-voltage battery can be charged with a direct current on a corresponding charging station. The whole charging socket on the vehicle should be used for charging with a direct current → Fig. 135 B ④. When using a direct current, you can only charge with an immediate charging start → Immediate charging and timer-controlled charging  . The high-voltage battery is charged with a charging power of up to 40 kW. The charging process is carried out with a fixed charging cable on a compatible charging station.

Charging for the first time and charging after long standing periods 
If the high-voltage battery is charged for the first time or charged after the vehicle has been standing for a long period, it is possible that the maximum charging level of the high-voltage battery cannot be reached. This is for technical reasons and does not represent a vehicle malfunction. If the maximum charge level is not reached even after several charging procedures, have the high-voltage battery checked by a qualified workshop.

If the vehicle is not used for a long period, the high-voltage battery must be charged after 4 months at the latest →







 .

Then two notices:








NOTICE
(my emphasis) Frequently charging the vehicle with a high charging power, in particular with a direct current (DC charging), can lead to a permanent reduction in the charging capacity of the high-voltage battery. Charge the vehicle mainly with low charging power, in particular on a home charging station or with the supplied mains charging cable.















NOTICE
Not using the vehicle for long periods can cause damage to the high-voltage battery. Charge the high-voltage battery after 4 months at the latest.​So although there is reference to ""frequently charging with a high charging power"" there are no specifics on how many times you can charge in sequence.

On that basis this constitutes only a ""fair use"" provision and so there is no enforceable requirement never to charge three or more times in succession."

Hi,

We just got delivery of our e-Transporter and are very disappointed with the restriction to 3.6kW/h charging too. You mentioned you have a copy of the old brochure that states it can charge at 7.2kW.

Thanks. Yes the brochure states 7kw using a wallbox. And the VW dealers referred us to an EV installer and we also had quotes locally, but we decided to wait as we may move house soon. We purchased our own 3pin EVSE home charger (none supplied with the van) and luckily that is working for us fine. 
They have offered a free service but I'm not sure if that is sufficient compensation? This is a lease van and a very low price per month and it is a really great van, lovely to drive. I was wondering whether as a commercial vehicle they expect you to charge at a workplace, but even then I'm not sure those would have 3 phase necessarily? 

We have a 20A cable that came with the van and I have obtained a 32A I can also try with it, so I am going to test it on the local 7kw BP Pulse to see what charging times I get and video it for evidence.

I’m not sure how the Citigo/e-up are setup on board charger wise, I think it’s the same, but VW did rollout a fix to make the e-up charge at 32A/7.2kW (with the 32A cable of course) on UK household supplies. I would expect they’d be able to do that with the van as well?

Hi NRGr6

Glad they are helping you with compensation, they have agreed the same with us. I did the same and took it up to the Executive Office of VW. Its just so frustrating that this wasn't thought about in the first instance. 

We love the van, it really is perfect for our needs. which is why it is such a shame they cannot simply retrofit with an onboard charger that can charge on single phase at 7kw?

Are you getting 3.4kw on your Zappi at home?"
4,1,2023-05-04,"...

VW do know and your dealer can find out. The car will have a status code that'll be one of the following:
00 = Assigned to factory order no production week scheduled
10 = Factory ordered with production week scheduled
20 = Factory ordered production week confirmed
30 = In transit from factory
36 = Vehicle in port of exit – not released
38 = Vehicle in port of exit – released to shipping
39 = Vehicle on ship
40 = Vehicle arrival at UK port
60 = Dispatched to dealer
70 = Vehicle arrived at dealer

When my ID.3 was built the dealer told me when it was status code 30 but were reluctant to go into more detail as the final stages move quite quickly (ie typically only a few weeks, rather than many months for the prior stages). The cars arrive in the UK at Sheerness (for Southern dealers) and Grimsby (for Northern dealers) from Emden. If you're especially obsessive, you can find out which ships are sailing and guess when it'll arrive in the UK. I was a bit obsessive when my ID.3 was on its way, so I totally understand the excitement/frustration - you're nearly there!"

Same the iphone/ipad app ones - all 10 bars show full when charging complete.

Like some others have suggested, a way of seeing actual % ( of consumer usable capacity ) would be useful.
@Simon hvt do you know if customers can do so ? I expect only VW staff can, through you/their diagnostics? 

Although at one point yesterday I saw 8bars full ( of the 10 ) and theory range was 17 ( climate was on ). 
8/10 doesn't equal 17 over 26 ( assuming 26 max in theory when charged with climate on ) . < sigh > 

Bloody thing is still showing 27miles eRange --- regardless of who drives it, it never seems to think it could go further.

I didn't use my old type 2 cable very often and when I did it was usually overnight at a hotel so slow charging wasn't a problem, but previously there were posts I expected to get 7kW from but it often seemed much slower. Have used my new cable on one of them (twice) and certainly got the full 7kW charging speed.

I would actually say that an EV that has a limited number of recharges on a long run is 'not fit for purpose'.

If this were my situation, it would *have* to be an email to VW to clarify the meaning of it, and if the reply was not favourable I would propose the car is not fit for purpose if the battery cannot be used for a cross-country journey, and what do they want to do about it.

This is clearly a very significant limitation in the performance of the vehicle, which should have been declared clearly at time of purchase. I think it is a potentially very 'damaging' term for VWs reputation/EVs, because I guess this would be the same for the e-Up and I was all ready to buy one of those, but would have definitely returned the car if this apparent stipulation crawled out of the wood-work after purchase.

In fact, better still, I am interested enough to write to VW anyway as a prospective future customer.  At your convenience, Tim, could you please scan/photo the offending terms and post them up. Thanks.

339,1,2022-07-14,"Hi All, after battling to update the 2022/2023 world maps using discover care and direct download, i finally figured out why the system could not read the data contained on my personal SD card. I kept on getting the error no data, check source. Firstly, being in South Africa - my option forced me to download the 24gig (zipped) 29.7gig (unzipped) world map for the discover pro gen 2. . So when trying to use the discover care program to select the appropriate update, it always failed with the checksum after 4hours of downloading the massive update and would then delete the update from my SD card. I then tried the alternative method, I downloaded the update zip file directly. Unzipped it and tried to copy it over to my 32gig SD card. The unzipped update file was a few mb's over and 29.7 capacity of the 32Gig SD card. The windows PC automatically formatted the 32gig SD card by default to FAT32 format. When i used a 64gb SD card, the default format settings was exFAT. I directly copied the unzipped folder across from PC to the SD card. This was the issue - Copy the contents of the unzipped folder i.e. Mib1 folder and Mib2 folder and a text file. The VW Tiguan was able to update the SATNAV maps and only chose all associated countries within SA (botswana, namibia, etc). So i also tested this out. I used the 32GB SD card and deleted all countries (from australia to other non related countries) from 2 x NAVDB folders. The map size reduced from 29.7gig unzipped to around 8gig. This was amazing, as the Tiguan was still able to update the maps to 2022/2023. To ensure the Tiguan / VW is able to read the data source, ensure you only copy the Mib1, Mib2 folders and the text file that is contained in the root zip folder name P101_N60S5MIBH3_ROW. Do not copy the P101_N60S5MIBH3_ROW folder name - only the contents within."

How to update maps for dummies (me included)
1. Download file from VW maps (just google search) save to desktop
2 Download zip software and open. its called 7zip, link is on VW map page
3. you need a 32 gig card put in computer ready
4. This is where I hit issues ,format card, by right click on sd card format fat 32. You cannot copy to it with copy and paste or dragging ,the SD card will not accept it, just says file is too big which its not. Helpful but wrong advice on line is to E Fat format for larger files works , but the satnav cannot read e fat format..
6.Make a couple or more copies of the downloaded sat nav files just in case, It takes an hour to download and if you mess up it gets very boring repeating
7.At this point right click on the un zipped satnav file, you will see 7zip option click on that it opens a box ,click open, its the top option.
This opens a second box with options and below the file you download ,click on that it opens and you see two folders and a text page symbol. along the top of the box you will see extract option in blue, click on this it opens another box.
it will show where its going to extract to, ignore it the symbol next to that is clicked and options of where you can extract to are offered ,choose your SD card which you have installed, click extract and because the files is transferring slowly your SD card will now accept it, takes an hour aprox. when its done right click on SD card and hit eject SD card.
pop SD card into satnav hard drive in glove box, on options in satnav update from sd card , it takes an hour.
8. All the procedures are on the vw website or elsewhere with pics if your not sure.
But the screw up for me. is not explained anywhere I could find, you cannot just transfer the data in a normal copy way, and the refusal to accept it, I thought I was being clever deleted Albania ,to reduce file size but it screwed up , another hour download ,hence make a couple of copies on your desktop before you start.

I am sure there are better ways but it works."

Also on the cable VW has form on this in the past early e-Golfs came with lower power cables and some got free swaps from VW I think. it may be to do with the fact that 3 phase power at home is much more common in Germany and so you can get away with a smaller cable and still get 11kw on 3 phase."

Is it the original yellow supplied VW cable?
Could well entail a visit to a main VW dealer for a replacement type2 - type2 cable.
Type2 cables have a small resister; to allow the charger to know the maximum current draw allowed.

We have had an occasional failure whilst charging using external chargers using the VW supplied lead. Less so whilst at home on our Rolec tethered.

Same as you, swipe your RFID card, insert charger end plug, insert car end plug, several seconds later; either no start of charging or an error light at the charge socket. Usually that’s the order to follow, but I’ve found the odd charger needs coaxed into giving out a charge.
Sometimes giving the plug at either end a firm push insertion, especially if the lead has the rubber storm shrouded collar that was a retrospective upgrade to help prevent rain ingress into the car charge socket, to help protect it from freezing.

Best option as previously suggested is using another type2 lead, more so at the same charge point if this is going to be a regular haunt.

Being tied to the past (they were founded by the Nazis, and can trace a continuous management succession since then) and then forgetting about it, and ignoring moral questions that will be raised, is a management structure that 'has lost its moral compass', as he says. 

How that that be doubted?

Unlikely to be either of these issues. There is a known issue with the way these vehicles handle single phase charging. I believe marketing material has now been altered to remove the references to 7kW charging. There are some threads about the Skoda Citygo where owners were struggling to get the problem acknowledged, let alone rectified, although I think some have now had a fix applied. Certainly grounds for rejection as the vehicle is substantially not as advertised."

It generally advantageous to connect the vehicle to the electricity mains via a charging cable even when the high-voltage battery is fully charged. For example, the vehicle interior can be cooled or heated while it is stationary, the 12-volt vehicle battery can be charged and further electrical consumers in the vehicle can be operated via the charging cable.

I thought continually plugging in and keeping the battery at 100% charge is the worst thing you can do to the battery. Unless the BMS doesn't charge if the battery is nearly full already."

There was a similar issue with the original A250e MB which was designed to charge on 11kW 3 phase. In the end some owners modified their own charge cables to give the single phase from their charge points to two of the phase lines on the 3 phase input. This gave 7.2 kW charging but at the risk of overloading the Neutral line within the car.

To be honest, even if you were getting the max advertised e-Transporter range (WLTP 82 miles?), knocking 64 miles off before you even start a days work doesn’t sound very practical?

I don’t think the van is faulty, it is what it is, but sounds like you’ve been led to believe it will do something that it really won’t, no doubt exacerbated by a seller who doesn’t really understand what they’re selling and keen to just get the sale.

It might be difficult to reject it as faulty, but clearly sounds like you’ve been sold something that won’t work for how you need to use it."

I have a Project EV home charger rated to 7.2kw and it's deffinately not charging my new e-transporter to that rate. I spoke to Project EV who remotely looked at the data from my charger and confirmed it's charging at 3.6kw and believed either the cable or vehicle was restricting the charge rate. 

I spoke to a VW Commercial vehicle service manager and he lacked any real knowledge. I queried the range not offering 82 as expected and he did say the suggested range after a full charge is affected by previous driving and usage. This makes sense as after I have improved my driving efficiency the suggested range is improving after full charges. 

I'm sure I've read that this vehicle can charge up to 50kw with a DC charger that can charge to that rate. I'm not sure what the next steps should be but I think we should all make our concerns clear to VW. Strength in numbers."

2456,1,2016-02-25,"Actually, to be fair, my local dealer did seem to love the GTE. There was always one in the showroom, two demonstrators and a couple on the forecourt. They moved the cars around a fair bit, but the GTE seemed to often be the centre piece, at least half the times when I visited. The first day I went into the dealership and was looking at it, a couple of salesmen who commented on it to me gave me the impression that the knew as much about it as the other cars.

I was mostly dealing with a relatively new salesgirl who gave me a test drive in a Scirroco (I've always loved them and wanted a side-by-side comparison to the GTE) but the main salesman took over from her for my GTE test drive because he said he knew a lot about the GTE and she hadn't been out in the car herself yet, so she came as a passenger to learn more about the car herself. During the test drive, he clearly knew what he was talking about and made sure he explained and demonstrated all the GTE features. He also gave me over 30 minutes on the test drive, so I could try out all the different modes on a variety of roads from twisty country lanes to a 5 mile stretch of dual carriageway.

It was slightly different when I came to sign up - he seemed convinced that the sat nav was on the base GTE (I know this was a recent change across the rest of the Golf range), but then kept managing to find the GTE Nav when quoting prices! He also didn't know anything about car-net and had to delegate that question to another salesman - although to be fair, it wouldn't have been enabled on any of their MY15 demonstrators anyway, and the other salesman did seem very clued up.

On the whole, I'd say it was a very positive experience - the dealer knew about the GTE, what made it special and didn't try to sway me towards an ICE-only car, and moreover they were prepared to go the distance to make sure that I knew what was special about the GTE too.

My comparison was Nissan who promised me an extended test drive over the phone, then over a couple of weeks punted me from dealer to dealer, each who (unbeknownst to the Nissan UK) didn't actually offer the extended test drive, before saying I could try a dealership 15 miles from home (my local Nissan dealer is less than a mile from my house) and they didn't know when they'd be able to let me do the test drive anyway.

Current wiring regulations say that any outlet that is to be ""designated for electric vehicle charging"" must be on a dedicated circuit. Since you have no spare ways in your consumer unit then your electrician hasn't done that; he's most likely fitted a fused spur to an existing ring main.

Whilst I agree that the e-Transporter sounds like an electric van that won’t meet everybody’s needs from such a vehicle, how easy is it to reject an electric vehicle based on it not meeting it’s advertised WLTP range?

I think the best chance would be to approach the supplying dealer and say you were sold something that wasn’t fit for your stated requirements and hope they play ball.

The problem here is that the van doesn’t appear to be faulty, so straight up rejection will be difficult.

With presumably even EV Van residuals silly high though, it might give the dealer room for manoeuvre to swap it for something more suitable for the users needs."

If anyone is getting an e-Golf don't rely on the VW website to be accurate as to who can definitely service it.

That was part of the reason that I opted for the GTE this time round as I did not want the hassle of not being able to get serviced withing 100 miles - a real problem if your real world mileage is less than that.

In the cold weather, the wet or fast driving and your range will plummet. My LEAF GOM varies between 80 and 130 miles at 100% charge, your van will vary even more given the aerodynamics and load capacity.

But I wouldn't rely on these chargers because there's almost no way to check if they're working before you leave the house. Like others above have already suggested, I use the Ecotricity rapids at Folkestone services (2 x CCS iirc) and have the Bannatynes Instavolt as a backup.

The chargers in Calais were busted and again no way to have known before setting off. Basically charging at Eurotunnel is a bit of an added bonus to your trip when they work.

I take it to mean the cars onboard charger, the thing most people see as the charger is actually the Electric Vehicle Supply Equipment (EVSE) and just acts as the interface between the car and electricity supply. 

The fact that production was halted whilst they identified a new cadmium free part might help explain why supply of VW EVs and Hybrids has been restricted. 

Now, if when they do the recall they upgrade the charger so that it can do 7kW, that would be great. I know, wishful thinking...."
450,1,2021-12-31,"...

Unless Abt have done something to the drivetrain setup, as far as I know it’s the same system as the e-Golf/e-Up, which both charge at 7.2kW on a 32A UK supply.

In the e-Up, I believe the higher rate charging only happens once the car is registered with WeConnect, do you have App control in the Transporter?

I would think it is something Abt/VW should be able to fix, and if not I’d be looking at rejection and/or some form of recompense as the van is a lot less useable at 3.6kW max AC charging."
2028,1,2017-10-12,"...

I assume that this is related, at least in part, to the high temperatures generated by repeated rapid battery cycles. The question then boils down to how you manage this on a long journey. To get round the letter, if not the spirit, of the warranty statement, you could do a short 7 kW AC charge followed by a third rapid charge. However, that would not help the underlying issue of the battery temperature. More specific guidance on this from VW would be welcome. For example, what would be the acceptable minimum period of time between charges, given that there appears to be no dashboard indication of battery temperature? There must be some inbuilt tapering to limit charging rates when the battery temperature reaches a predetermined level. Why is this not sufficient to manage the problem?"

You can‘t have a Gridserve Norwich everywhere though, there’s still a need for lower cost solutions that can be installed on lower power connections.

The battery is just a buffer I guess, allowing rapid speeds once charged and ready to deliver, but not sure what happens if you have a run of cars that have just charged, I suppose you’ll get lower speeds until the battery buffer has sufficient energy in it again.

Consider what was put in this article, which is accused above of being 'sloppy';-

""There is no official confirmation from Volkswagen about what size battery will be tucked under the floor of the new ID hatchback sedan — which may or may not be called Neo — but Express says a 111 kWh battery is what industry observers expect.""

From the screen you’ve put in 8.77 kWh in 1hr 16m so roughly 7kW.

The chargers are actually on the van, yours has two of them (L1 and L2) you can see they’re capable of 16A each or thereabouts, hence the near 32A charge speed you’re seeing.

It would need a third on board charger to get 11kW, and if all three chargers were 32A only then would you see 22kW."

1440,1,2019-01-14,"Right some quick feedback with some pointers:

I have my own POI uploaded into the SatNav. They are visible on the map, they can be selected and navigated to.
I created an extracted file from OpenChargeMap, but just selecting the CCS and exporting the file as a .kml file
I used my Garmin BaseCamp app on my Mac to load in the kml file just to have look where the various CCS charging points were. I found that one was listed with the Lat/Long of 0/0 which was very incorrect.
I removed that charging POI entry then exported from BaseCamp the set of POIs out as a .CSV file
I brought the .CSV into a spreadsheet app (eg Excel, LibreOffice, etc.) and removed several columns as the VW Car-Net app POI instructions stated that the columns in the .CSV these are Longitude, Latitude, Name - the other columns in the sheet can be removed. The sheet also needs to have the columns in the order as already mentioned. I saved out the POI as a .CSV.
I created a .PNG file as a new icon for these CCS charging points.
In Car-Net on my computer I went to the Guide & Inform section, used the My Points of Interest panel, and added a new list using the .csv file I had created and the .png icon file as well. I used the Save & send button to send towards my e-Golf 
In the e-Golf, I used my mobile phone as a hotspot and had connected the phone to the Discovery Pro SatNav. The SatNav then could get the POI file and it was added in.
The new points were visible on the map and the POI list was available from the menu of the SatNav.
As the file and icon are nothing special and the data obtained from the OpenChargeMap site, then I am happy to share them. The .csv file is zipped, and the icon is bright red to help it stand out on the map display. Of course, I did try the .kml file as straight into Car-Net, but it didn't like it; I cleaned up the .kml with the weird 0/0 location and Car-Net still didn't like it. I think that all of the descriptive elements on OpenChargeMap are in a large Description field and Car-Net just didn't like that. So I went the way with CSV, which puts much less information in but does work. My reasoning was that I have the details on Zap-Map, PlugCharge etc. anyway - I just want to be able to navigate to the charging point.

I hope that this helps."

Ahhhh yes of course then the cost of charging it out of hours, more problems, costing me about £4.00 per charge, 11pm-7am.

Good luck with that, fixing the chargers doesn't appear to have any urgency at all, the CCS at Cherwell has been faulty for weeks, well it was reported 2 or 3 weeks before they converted them over, they didn't even bother to fix it while the engineers were on site converting it and as at last weekend it was still faulty. 

With only one CCS pump of these sites it would be nice if they could fix them at some stage, even nicer would be something on the app to inform you that it doesn't work instead of having to continually go through the motions of charging to find out that it doesn't work but I guess that would expose the true state of the network which probably wouldn't match Ecotricity's claims "

No problem - it’s an interesting topic. My suspicion is the majority of people who have become EV drivers thus far are the type of people who do do the maths, and either have home charging (and switch to a provider like Octopus and/or maybe even have home solar), or, if they don’t have home charging they make sure to look into where they can charge cheaply locally (or even for free), or, they obtain an EV via a company such as Onto that provides all inclusive charging via certain networks."

Sounds like you are having an even worse time with it! I'm more annoyed that the van is costing twice as much to charge not being able to do most of it on the cheap rate. 
My wife has a BMW i3 and omg it shows how poor the VW is at charging similar battery size and it charges at 7.2kw, BMW actually bothered to design a product for the UK market with our single phase supplies in domestic dwellings. 

I am currently using the granny charger supplied with the BMW to charge while I'm on site at work (depending on customers I offer to pay and so far it's working) it is adding plenty of range to get home over the 9 hours! Annoyingly it seems to charge almost as quickly as my pointless 7.2kw fast charger I had installed to then find out VW only uses 3.6kw.

Do you find with your van if you slow to almost stopped and then try to accelerate it really struggles to get moving again I had a queue of unhappy people behind me as I struggled to get going again uphill today after the car in front of me turned right I was regenerating trying not to slow too much to catch them but no gaps in traffic for car in front to turn so I was still just crawling when I caught them up and tried to carry on. I struggled to reach 40mph but once there it was ok and picked up to 50mph easily, maybe just the usual VW dsg being dim and useless!"

It's hard to gauge this stuff though - the battery is oversized, so it's possible that until it's degraded by the ""extra"" amount you'd notice no difference at all 

In any case, I want to know this stuff in writing before I buy. It's not unreasonable to know and if VW won't provide it then I don't want to give them my money.

The car when fully charged gives a predicted range. Bit like filling up a normal ICE, the range to empty number is given. 
Take that normal ICE car, which say has an official mpg of 50, has a 10gallon tank, and so you leave the Esso petrol station with the range predicted as 500 miles perhaps. 
It's very rare the same driver will drive off on a 500mile trip there + then, and would therefore expect to get that figure. The trip profile would be varied, weather, traffic conditions, all vary a lot over that 500 miles such that if you got 450 you'd be happy. 
But with a PHEV that's exactly what we do, we see the predicted range and get upset that in single simple journeys we're repeatedly not getting near it ... I am sure a lot of GTE owners assumed ""they"" could do 28 easily. 
I hold my hand up...... ""I'm sure I'll, me, I'll get near it"" .... o 

We should be taking the official ""up to range"" only as a comparison guide against other vehicles, not as a regular expectation to be met. So the VW Golf GTE of up to 31 vs the plugin Prius or the Plugin Iconiq for example. 

Your expectation? - have a good trawl through the other experiences on this very helpful forum, it does vary based on each persons' situations and a load of factors. Generally: 15-20 real miles in Winter, 18-27 in summer I'd say.
My house records are 13.2 and 25.8. However I've also got over 1250 miles from a tank of unleaded and you may have read about Golf+Passat owners who stretched theirs over 2000miles. 
The car may work very well if you can charge it frequently between trips of say 18miles max. Perhaps that's your Mon-Fri profile then you also have a great car for longer blasts at the weekend. 

To get the most miles from the battery you need no more than 40mph roads, 16+deg dry weather and a willingness to have the Climate Control turned fully off ( window an inch down), and traffic loads that don't feature frequent sharp get-into-a-gap/across-the-roadabout acceleration. Motorway speeds, rain, and a need to get somewhere ASAP will drain it fast. Not that different to trying to get high mpg from an ICE - but because we are so focused on such a shorter and more immediately obvious result ( up to 31miles vs up to 500 ) we see the Did I / Didn't I sooner and more often. 

If you're coming to a GTE from a Prius type car you'll hate the Hybrid mode mpg on 50+mile trips, be aware.
45, maybe into 50's, again depending on a lot of factors. You can trickle along emissions free easily but it requires a heavy Eddie Stobart in front to let you bimble at its pace ( same as in a Prius, and the trigger point is about the same but requires relearning as the GTE behaves differently).
We used to have a Toyota HSD thing and could do last-mile-to-house on electrons. Took me a while to learn how get the Golf (in Hybrid Mode) to do the same. 
CruiseControl a big friend I've found, even in 30mph zones. Let the electronics start the ICE or not - you'll see where it uses the battery over the ICE but had you driven that road without cruise control the ICE may have been running more often. 

However having said all this, you can get a smile back by saying to yourself Sod It, and pressing the GTE button.
Prius + Inconiq drivers can't do that !! Try to enjoy the wait, read up, ask Qs, you will love the car. "

The thought of using an electric van fills him with horror, especially one that would be 50 miles between charges driven like he does.

The AC charging speed issue sounds like it will be solved by supply of the correct 32A charge cable. The supplying dealership should be able to sort this for anybody who is using a 20A cable.

It’s basically an e-Golf battery and drive train in these isn’t it, they should be pretty bullet proof.

Whilst this thread has lots of disappointed new owners in it, given that in the cold and with less than careful driving (eg high speed) my old e-Golf would be low on charge around 110 miles, I’m not surprised that a much bigger and heavier van could be half that.

It seems that the e-transporter is aimed at folks requiring a van for deliveries/multiple drops in a big city, where speeds are low and distances covered not that high.

First of all I cannot believe that you virtually never go outside a ten mile radius of your home. Maybe you have another car for long journeys or prefer the train.

24,1,2023-04-06,"Hi Both,

Thanks for reading, and I've tried to be as objective as possible - I've just driven 150 miles back from Devon this morning, and apart from the assist errors popping up then disappearing (leaving me with the random lighting up of the blindspot mirror lights) then popping up again and disabling the blindspot indicators again, it was a thoroughly pleasurable drive up the M5 with the cruise control on!

@raspy thanks for your comments, and you're correct about it being an executive, rather than luxury car (I'll update my original post after this!), however the quality of some of the interior materials push it a little further, especially for a VW (in my opinion), and having sat in a colleague's much more expensive Merc just after I got it, which had a horribly plasticky cheap feeling interior, it made me feel even more happy with my choice at the time.

You're also absolutely correct in that I should've driven the car I was going to live with - I drove a Cupra Formentor hybrid, which has the updated powertrain giving a combined 240+bhp, and it was worked really well in the smaller, lighter car, I had no problems with drivability just on ICE...the only reason I didn't go for it was because the boot was tiny, and I even went back to the dealer to see if all my dive gear could fit in it, which it couldn't, so unfortunately it was out of the game.

This is the first new car I've ever had, as all my previous cars have been personal purchases of used cars, so I have driven the car I'm going to buy in the past - lesson learnt for next time!

I'm also not going to say that the problem with the assist system is a widespread problem (we know what forums are like), I just think that the dealer I used was clueless/useless - I had three different responses on each visit - firstly that they see it all the time during winter because the cars are so dirty the radar systems don't work properly so I needed to clean it more (If that's the case, the system's not fit for purpose, and I'd had 15 months of trouble-free motoring, often with the car being filthy); second visit was no fault found (even though I have photos and videos spanning a couple of months, showing the errors clearly there); and thirdly, a software update to cure it, which actually transpired to be an infotainment system update (so they lied about what they did), and then told me to contact VW UK if I wasn't happy, as that's how the assist systems work! That dealer experience compounds my feelings of disappointment, however the dealer I'm speaking to now seems to have some ideas already, and agrees that it is a problem - if it gets fixed, I'll live with it (I have no choice!), and have adjusted and adapted my driving style to accommodate it's limitations, so it's OK.

@urpert , I really appreciate your comments regarding the Superb, as after my ownership experience with the Octavia (infotainment system aside), it was probably the best car I've owned, so I specced up a nice Sportline Hybrid, but couldn't square away a more expensive monthly lease cost for a much cheaper car. It sounds like I'd have been pretty much in the same boat had I made that choice anyway.

Looking at possible options for the future, whether that been sooner rather than later, I've looked a the Outlander and RAV4, as I do want something that can haul the weight of a hybrid comfortably without having to work it, and I want 4WD, having had it with my Octavia, it does just feel a lot safer, and especially with my experience, the weight of the car, and the torque from the electric motor just cause grip to be limited!

Have a great Easter both, and thanks again for your comments,

Nick"

Always a hot topic but I personally prefer it on the side. It's one of the things that's bugged me from going from an i3 to a GTE, now the charging point is at the front it makes it a pain positioning the car in the garage to leave enough space at the front to charge and enough space at the back to be able to open the boot to let the dogs in.

With our new positioning and structure, we have laid a foundation that will enable the Group and its brands to tackle the ongoing technological revolution. E-mobility is coming: it's the engine of the future. And Volkswagen will be at the forefront of this work – as the automaker that takes the electric car out of its niche and introduces it to the mass market. Our “Roadmap E” is the most ambitious electrification initiative our industry has ever seen: depending on market development, our Group aims to manufacture and sell up to 3 million all-electric cars per year by 2025. At that time, we will offer our customers more than 80 new electric models, including around 50 all-electric vehicles. This year, the eight battery electric cars and plug-in hybrids we already have in our portfolio will be supplemented by ten additional models. The next highlight will begin rolling off the assembly line at the end of August: the Audi e-tron. The first premium electric car from our Group will set standards – and demonstrate just how fascinating electric mobility is. This also holds true for the Porsche Mission E and the Volkswagen I.D. family that will be produced in Germany, respectively, starting in 2019. By 2020, we will offer our customers more than 25 new electric models and more than 20 plug-in hybrids. In just a few years’ time, then, across all brands and regions we aim to put the world’s largest fleet of electric vehicles on the road. This includes our commitment to help expand the necessary charging infrastructure, for instance through the IONITY joint venture, which is setting up 400 fast-charging stations along major routes across Europe. Our commitment to systematically prepare our plants for the age of electromobility – particularly here in Germany. And our commitment to gain the necessary know-how for cell technology in our Center of Excellence in Salzgitter. At the same time, we will secure the battery capacity we will need for our electric fleet. By 2025, we estimate that we will require 150 GWh per year. This will amount to a purchasing volume about 50 billion euros during this period, just for our volume Page 12 models based on the Modular Electrification Toolkit, or MEB. To date, the contracts awarded to suppliers have a volume of some €40 billion. As an aside, these figures clearly indicate that the industrial alliance needs to make a united effort to reopen an intensive dialog on setting up battery cell manufacturing capabilities in Europe. We are moving full steam ahead on the other major future trends as well. By the end of 2022, we will have invested more than €34 billion: in electromobility, autonomous driving, new mobility services and the digitalization of our products and the entire company. In the coming years, our joint ventures in China will take up an additional €15 billion for these technologies.

Is the M3 really in the luxury segment in terms of interior quality? I don't think it is head to head model wise but it is the consequences that mean VAG need to stop Tesla getting a strong position in Europe with the Model 3 because that helps provides Tesla with the funds to produce a Model Y which could really challenge the Golf sized segment. So they need a car to compete with a base model 3. OK no frunk in the Neo which I don't think is a huge deal breaker but it is a hatch back. That is key for sales in Europe. Getting a C segment sized interior into a B segment car by nor having a frunk and moving the A/C forward etc etc is IMHO a total sales winner in Europe. More space inside a car is a key luxury feature. 

The winner in terms of company survival is the one who gets to BEV volume sales first and gets the economy of scale so that they can price compete and still turn a fair profit. There is a bigger unit market to be had with B segment external sized cars. Model 3 production has ramped up quicker than the rest of the industry thought it would so VAG are now quickly trying to catch up. VAG know they can do quality but their unit margins are very slim compared the competition because of high labour costs so they have to have volume. 

Yes, the Koreans must have them very worried too but VAG should be able to trade on better quality to get sales for sometime yet and the Koreans have yet to produce a platform that will allow C segment interior in a B segment car. Look how many have declined the otherwise excellent Kona because of cramped interior space. The Neo looks to me like the step change successor to the Golf (just as the Golf was to the Beetle) and that is a huge market. Now Ford need to produce an electric Fiesta real quick otherwise they are going to be history."

Small in the auto maker business means niche and expensive products which are just a sideline to the main industry. Massive economy of scale is essential to be able to produce affordable, competitive, products. Telsa knows this and realised it has to grow super fast to bring significant change and started at the premium end and build a brand (badge) following as fast as possible by pouring in money and taking a very high risk approach. 

The major disappointment is that BEVs don't directly replace ICEs because of cost, availability and limitations. It will be a two step transition for the majority, hybrids will mainly replace ICEs and BEVs will replace hybrids. Only non-legacy car makers like Tesla can afford the risk to step directly to BEVs. For the others Hybrids seems the only way to get past the catch 22 of BEVs only being affordable when they are sold in quantity and not selling in quantity because they are not affordable. A mild/weak hybrid means weak sales. A really capable hybrid can be a different story. 

Nissan now have two E-Power models on sale in Japan and sales of both are extremely strong despite the platforms being old with declining sales in ICE form. 

VAG are at the very high risk end since they have such narrow margins due to very high production costs that they are over-exposed to being critically dependent on volume of sales."
1922,2,2017-02-09,"I will be very interested to see how this turns out. I will want to replace the family MPV (Ford S-max) with a PHEV or BEV. Choice is very limited, and very much at the premium end of the market.
My shortlist includes the following but I was hoping an alternative would be available before I want to change as I personally prefer the practicality and efficiency of an MPV to the large ineffecient wheels of SUVs currently in fashion:
- Tesla Model X - space more limited than I would ideally like and will need to wait for second hand price to become reasonable
- Volvo XC-90 T8 - space is good, but it really isn't that efficient given its bulk and shape even though it is a PHEV.

I have considered these other cars not already mentioned:
The Prius Plus is not a PHEV and too small anyway.
BMW 225xe is nice but too small as well.
Range Rover Sport hybrid is pricey and not as good as the Volvo.
BMW X5 x-drive40e and Audi Q7 e-tron are both limited to 5 seats.

It would be nice if Chrysler brought their Pacifica Hybrid to Europe. It is a pity Ford or VW are not putting their hybrid tech into MPVs/SUVs of a decent size. Fords MPVs are on the same platforms as the Mondeo which has a hybrid. And VW's MQB platform which includes their GTE models also includes the Touran.

Even an efficient 1.6 litre petrol will probably only do 20mpg over the first 2 or 3 miles at low loads in urban streets, but a diesel may already be delivering over 50 odd.

But PHEVs don't run their engines off load, that's exactly what makes a hybrid more efficient. Now, I'm not saying a diesel powered PHEV would not deliver better mpg, but it wouldn't be that much better. Say 5 to 10%. Dilute that down by the ratio of EV versus ICE driving you might do, say 50%, and you're looking at an overall improvement of 3 to 5% in fuel consumption. Translate that into a 60ish mpg overall for 15k miles a year (say) and that's around £40 in fuel. Now figure the diesel engine plus associated exhaust parts will cost an extra £700~£1,000 or so, where's the cost advantage in having a diesel? The mpg figures might look better, but it doesn't translate into a real gain, either in cost, exhaust quality, ride/NVH quality, repair and maintainability, recyclability. In fact, once you can run a petrol engine at pretty much full load all the time, diesels offer very little benefit. Peugeot have tried a hybrid diesel in their 308 and 508 and they don't really add much real-world benefit. They've dropped the diesel hybrid from their future range now. 

Does that cover it?"
2509,2,2016-09-19,"Blinging it up with gimmicks would be a bad way to go for VW, in my view. Firstly because VWs image has always been that of ""sensible, reliable, conservative"" cars. Not inspiring, but sell in droves to people who want understated cars with a reputation of reliability and consistent quality - the reality doesn't matter, that's what the buyers want, and feel they can get.

Many of the people who buy VWs probably aren't interested in the hi-tech futurism of EVs, but rather in the bottom line savings on maintenance and fuel - and would feel most comfortable with EVs that look and feel familiar - much like the current E-Golf/E-up. 

Go for a new platform, make the most of the space and go for a skateboard design (flat tray base built around the battery), shorten the bonnet as much as you can with conventional styling, push the cabin forward, and sling the motor itself on the rear axle to give RWD and super-tight turning circle. Hey presto, small car, big battery, lots of cabin space and way better handling and manoeuvrability than an ICE, and almost as clean as those squeaky clean diesels and bluemotion things. What more does the European market want than that? Oh, yeah, make the damn thing affordable. Anyone who can sell an electric car for under £500 per kw/h is going to be popular. If the yanks can at GM can do it, how hard can it be? Sure it'll steal some of your ICE profits, but guess what? Sooner or later you are going to have to go electric anyway. Might as well make a virtue out of necessity."

While it sounds like a valid strategy and certainly works well for hybrids, i'm just not sure if they will be able to compete with the prices on their BEV offerings. A big advantage of a pure EV platform, is that the complexity goes down considerably, which reduces the production costs. VW is estimating that the production cost from the ID is 35% lower than the e-Golf. The downside is, that you need to produce alot of cars to make it a worthwhile investment. They are loosing the scale advantages from using the MQB parts and developments though. Which is why VW NEEDS to produce alot of MEB cars to make it profitable. Which is certainly a good motivator.

Only time will tell, which strategy will give us more affordable products though and there are definitely interesting times ahead.

And about VW's strategy ""so far"": The E-Golf was always just a compliance car and a way to get some experience with EVs. But those experiences certainly helped them with the MEB. 
But it was not produced in high enough numbers for salespeople to actually sell it. So i'm not sure if you can really compare the situation from the E-Golf era with what they have planned for the MEB. They likely even lost money with every E-Golf sold..

And VW might be late a bit late with EVs in China. But their new MEB Factory (SAIC-VW Jointventure) will also start production in early 2020 and help with scale."

If you're being a bit more objective, then I think the article is what it is, i.e. honest. 

The uncomfortable truth for some is that we need the ICE (and that includes diesel) for the next 10 or 15 years at least, as we simply can't flick a switch and move over wholesale to electric vehicles, even if we all wanted to. 

Euro VI compliant diesels have similar emissions levels as the latest petrols, and the trick for governments and automakers is to not throw the baby out with the bath water. There is no reason why internal combustion engines can't become even cleaner than they are now, as we transition in a controlled manner to a more sustainable model. Part of that transition will likely include pushing the worst polluting vehicles off the road with taxes or incentives. 

As for the Tesla comparison thing, he's right isn't he? Tesla are not yet a direct competitor to VW in either size, financials or product range. And yes, I'm aware that part of that assertion is that VW don't really have anything to compete with the Model S/X/3 either.

Why would they discount? Given the blind brand loyalty exhibited by many, one would suspect the most expedient course of action to be an increase in prices. The ""I must have a Golf"" person will still insist on their Golf; if you can screw an extra £500 out of them then it will go a long way towards paying any fines. If you pop over to pistonheads or similar motoring forums you can see the VAG-loyalists blaming US protectionism (probably some truth in that) and the VAG-haters crowing over the ""victory"" (probably short-sighted given the vulnerability of other manufacturers - ever seen the GM gear-lock fudge?).

Now, VW have 3.5 million sales in Europe each year. Most of those made ""because it's a VW/Audi"" not on the basis of any objective decision making. Add £500 to each car and you have made £175 million towards the fine without making any effort at all. 

Announce closure of your US sales operation and indicate you will also be closing your US factory (the one that makes Passats) and you can start negotiating down the US fine/penance.

Seems like the easiest approach to damage limitation to me. They are lucky to be in the position of not having to match market prices in a large portion of their customer base - an Apple-like approach to pricing is possible."

We come back to suspension design again. 

2013 Lexus GS 350 F Sport Suspension Walkaround on Edmunds.com

Also watch Fifth Gear's ""review"" of the GS450h, where Jason Plato and Tiff Needell are (pointlessly) trying to get the GS to drift. They actually find that even without traction control on the suspension setup (as described in the above edmunds article) is designed toward understeer (by mounting the front tie rods ahead of the steering axis). Eventually by being very silly with the car (with traction off) they finally got the tail out and spun it rather than drifted it - the point being that if you deliberately upset the weight balance of a car you can make the back come around and swap ends, regardless of whether it is FWD or RWD. 

The real reason that EVs will return en-masse to RWD is the exact same reason that ICE cars went FWD - packaging. Once EVs are being built on EV-specific production lines (like Teslas) then the packaging benefits of a small motor in the rear subframe are every bit as strong as those for having the ICE stack in the front with no propshaft, diff, etc. 

They will not be oversteer monsters because they are RWD. 

BMW have played a terrible trick on people over the years - ""Perfect 50:50 weight distribution"", RWD and cars prone to oversteer. Oversteer appeals to a certain segment of the automotive market (think JC smoking the tyres in a drift while yelling ""Power!"") and that segment is in BMW's core brand territory. However, BMW's ""perfect 50:50 weight distribution"" is anything but. What they actually do is build a regular car with a longitudinal engine and gearbox, so the weight distribution is about 55:45 (and better than say my V70 with a transverse engine ahead of the front axle), but then they ""even it out"" by sticking some heavy things like the battery out at the back end of the boot. By moving it as far outside of the wheelbase as possible it has a big impact on the weight distribution, and they bring the weight distribution to 50:50 that way. 

However, while that's fine and true statically, dynamically it is not. The moment you try to change direction the back end wants to carry on going in the direction it was because there's a big chunk of weight behind the rear axle - it immediately tries to pull the car into oversteer. Compare to a Tesla Model S (48:52) where the weight is very much within the wheelbase and you'll find it much more neutral. 

As a very simple experiment on this concept, take a cocktail stick and stick two olives or grapes or whatever on it, one at each end. Take another cocktail stick and stick two olives in the middle. Both have 50:50 weight distribution, both are perfectly balanced statically, but dynamically they behave very differently in their polar moments (Hmmm. Must register trademark for the ""oversteer martini""). 

Ultimately... yes it is wise. The production and packaging benefits, as well as improved tyre lifetime and more predictable acceleration under EV torque, combined with safe suspension design will bring more benefits."

1627,2,2018-10-24,"I'll defer to your greater knowledge dbmandrake - in my case a little knowledge being a dangerous thing. 

The point stands though that weight distribution, suspension design in general (away from specifics!) and tyre balance/quality have much more to do with day-to-day handling than which wheels are driven. 

In the case of vehicles where 2WD and AWD options exist then the handling of the AWD option broadly follows that of the vehicle on which it is based - it doesn't tame the understeery nature of a very front-heavy V70 for example. 

I stand by my original point, however, is that things like the VW ID will not be an oversteery mess that wants to throw you into a hedge, and in fact will likely be more benign than FWD vehicles of similar power/torque (eg the Kona, which has some reports of significant torque-steer. No, I haven't driven it). Partly that might be achieved through stability control software, and that's fine too - it's the end result that matters."
2431,2,2016-10-18,"VW decided to standardise on two modules made up with the same cells but different sizes and then fit the different modules into the available space on the platform. The theory was that by standardising on only two modules and one type of cell they would get a much simplified logistics situation. The problem is that they've locked themselves into a cross platform option that optimises nothing apart from the logistics. It's also partly been driven by the fact that they wanted to use the same packs for HEVs and PHEVS so the individual modules needed to have a good power capability. As the article says that works for a HEV, to a more limited extent for a PHEV and not at all well for a BEV. The BEV plans were also compromised by using a platform designed to take an ICE - hence the two module sizes to fit around all those bits of the design that are utterly useless in a BEV. 

To some extent I think VW have castrated themselves by their emphasis on designing for cross platform volume, but there are some advantages in that you get economies of scale at a much lower level."

I didn't know there was a comfort calculator but found one that gives the same numbers to yours here:

Wheel / Tyre Combo Calculator

I found comfort values for standard Golf sizes:

205/55 R16: 6.5 (my car and e-Golf)
225/45 R17: 4.7
225/40 R18: 2.9 (standard UK spec Golf GTE)

If this calculator is accurate even the 20 inch wheels should give greater comfort that 18 inch wheels on a Golf. And 18 inch wheels will be more comfortable than the 16 inch wheels on an e-Golf.

Range and fuel efficiency is normally better with a smaller wheel due to decreased and more centralised weight which means less power is needed to turn the wheel. Of course very light alloy rims can offset this effect.

Noise is usually lower on a tire with a larger side wall (smaller wheel diameter) due to the attenuation properties of a larger cushion of air."

I think it is more like 'where it would have gone, had it been an ICE'. The Ampera/Volt could arguably have a battery pack in the 'propshaft tunnel' but there is no ICE/RWD equivalent. It's a good place to put a battery if you think about crash safety, battery heating/cooling, chassis polar moment, etc., better, in fact, than a monolithic slab in every respect except ease of manufacturing and the utility of a flat cabin floor.

I think it is also wrong to look at some cars as 'converted ICE' cars. These days, platforms are being designed for flexibility to accept all sorts of drive-trains, not only ICE.

Bit of info about the battery technology for those who are interested:

""High Ni content is important to improve capacity, so a 20% increase from NMC 622 (or almost 50% from NMC 111) pushes the capacity of NMC 811 to around 200 mAh/g"" 

That is roughly on a par with the power density of a Tesla Model S which uses NCA chemistry, although Tesla have stated that the Model 3 has 30% higher battery density than that.

Samsung SDI are the current supplier for Volkswagen (plus BMW and Mercedes) after they switched from Panasonic/Sanyo who continue to supply Tesla and Toyota. LG Chem currently supply the Renault-Nissan-Mitsubishi Alliance."

I'm not so sure, they can build every part of the car other than the battery cheaper than Tesla, because they already have massive factories and huge supply chain partners. And the battery, well, today, Tesla don't make that either, so VW could buy them just as cheaply as Tesla. And a 90kwh Tesla S is £67k, with a healthy profit margin. VW -could- sell this bus for around £40k I believe, maybe even less. I am confident an OEM can actually buy production quantities of batteries for around £100 per kwh today. Yes that's raw cells, but VW could assemble them into modules/packs in Changchun a lot cheaper than in Fremont.

1606,2,2018-10-22,"Front wheel drive isn't superior. You're asking the front wheels to steer and provide drive traction.

The only reason front wheel drive is good on modern ICE cars over RWD (as in RWD tends to oversteer) is because you've got a heavy engine over the front two wheels, which gives you extra grip compared to a RWD car.

RWD for EVs is ideal because there's no heavy engine and at least in higher battery capacity EVs the weight of the drive unit is insignificant so you put power down at the rear and steer at the front. Weight balance is pretty even. Model 3 is almost 50/50. AWD motors for EVs will always be biased towards the rear with the front only kicking in under high acceleration or for cruise efficiency."

I agree with @Cheshirecat, they've been building the e-UP! for years at a premium of about £8k list price over the ICE version, with long waiting lists, taking advantage of government grants to bring the price down to something vaguely respectable (until they closed the order books entirely), it's not like they couldn't foresee demand.

Not because it's RWD. It's a city car, not a performance car.

It's actually nimble and fun to drive at lower speeds within it's grip limits, but push it hard around corners and especially around bumpy corners and it will lose the plot.

It takes years to prepare and it involves alot of ""doing"" and not just words.

Is PSA currently building or retooling any factories for EV production? I haven't heard of anything. How many can they produce, if they are going to have to share the production capacities with their ICE counterparts?

I have no doubt that PSA will come out with great cars in 2019. But i have not seen any indications so far, that they are going for big numbers.

It is possible but debatable all the same.

The 3008 hybrid was out long before VW had a hybrid so they are not new to the technology. There are also some interesting PHEVs being released.

What is less clear is how far they are along in developing BEVs, although they have announced their intention to do so. It would be interesting to know how much of the intellectual property to the Chevy Bolt/Opel Ampera E they got when they acquired Opel.

The only thing I can remember them announcing is that they intend to have multiple drive trains including electric across their model range. Having multiple electric models would help mass market adoption. But I haven't seen anything as far on in development as VW would have us believe the ID is, with order books supposed to be opening in the UK next spring.

They're a no brainier. eGolfs on the other hand, whilst being a perfectly good car don't really offer abything other than brand image and perceived quality over the competition. They're more expensive and don't offer as good range. I can see why as a retailer you could view them as a bit of a ball ache, and my guess is they get 50 GTE enquiries for every eGolf. 

So, as and when VW have an electric car which offers a unique value/range/quality/image proposition, dealers will be all over it and they'll sell loads. Now I just hope it happens before my lease is up."
2610,2,2016-01-06,"Article says VW's new battery tech provides 331 miles with a 94.6 on the European cycle (presumably NEDC).

The Tesla Model S 85D, using a battery introduced in 2012 and which has ~10.5% less capacity, manages 330 miles (1 mile less) on NEDC.

So Volkswagen with their much-hyped battery research are proposing to have a battery in 2018 that performs worse than the battery Tesla had in 2012, as well as having poorer acceleration and a lower top speed.

By the time this car is introduced, the Model 3 should be readily available even if Tesla miss their 2017 deadline by a year.

I very much doubt that VW are pushing that line from the centre. 

As for the other part of the story that the cars would perform badly in the small offset front test compared to a car designed to do well in it, well that seems more of a failure in the crash testing regime of ENCAP rather than VW. I expect most European cars would struggle.

Electric motors like ICEs are well understood technology. Lithium-ion batteries are still being understood. One false move pushing the chemistry too far in the quest for more energy density and energy per kg when coupled with high volume production or significant proportion of total product and a manufacturer could put their business at risk of going under. To survive they know they have to switch to EVs but at the same time going into EVs increases the probability of having risks that are harder to quantify and control. Hence this 'toe in the water' approach by established makers until being unable to sell ICEs makes it a total imperative to switch to EVs."

A Golf Rex would be of interest to me, although I'm waiting to see how the new e-Golf shapes up in terms of real world range and pricing.

Since dieselgate, apart from the high profile withdrawal from top line motorsport (Le Man/WRC etc) a lot of smaller engineering projects have been culled and a rethink of the whole range has ensued.

Isn't it all about packaging? No engine, gearbox, fuel tank or exhaust system gives you a lot of room to play with, and the whole architecture can change from the ground up with the battery sandwiched in the floor. Tesla does this to some extent, but retains the traditional car shape to avoid alienating conservative customers. A cabin-forward car with the same dimensions as a golf would have a massive interior on the same footprint. It might take a while to get used to the proportions, but it is entirely doable. The original Mercedes A Class had as much rear legroom as an S Class due to its can forward packaging. That was 20 years ago."

The biggest car manufacturer starting to sell BEVs at the same price as a diesel is a big step in the right direction and will enable many more people to make the switch.
Tesla are still quite a way off being able to make really affordable BEVs. If VW can do that quicker, great. If it helps to clean up the air around us then I will buy whatever is available and affordable."

Well, in this case, you can't accuse me of not knowing what I am talking about as you might usually do. I've been embedded in the middle of mass automotive manufacturing for 20 years.

They have 100 years experience of integrating cars with ICE. The 'manufacturers' themselves, of course, these days make very little on the car other than the chassis, buying in virtually the whole of the rest of the car from 1st tier suppliers, many of whom supply virtually the same product to multiple manufacturers.

But that's £6k more than a high spec automatic petrol Up (a P-Up?) and if you just want the vehicle for local stuff and therefore not worried about running costs, that £17k becomes hard to justify.
It could have been so different. It should have been a case of the customer torn between taking a petrol auto or an electric auto for the same price from day one when VW introduced E-Up.
Now that would have been real commitment."

I am thinking that this will be a great car. In my view it will beat the Tesla Model 3 on two major counts:

Its a hatchback and not a saloon (aka sedan) - I'm just want more practicality
The price
But, the glass roof? If, as in the e_golf, we cannot have a towing hitch for even a mounted cycle carrier then what about roof rails for carrying bicycles? I wonder if any roof rails would fit with the glass roof. Yes I know that they would really bring down the efficiency but for practicality again, it should be an option."

So, my fact was a fact then. The e-Golf also outsold direct rivals such as the Nissan Leaf.

To say any corporation is ‘evil’ is ridiculous. Do they only recruit ‘evil’ people? As I’ve posted elsewhere, the dieselgate scandal has cost VAG billions, but it may be the salvation of both VAG and the motor industry.

There are other components to efficiency besides just the drag coefficient. The Model Y, for example, is a very fast car with a powerful motor - it stands to reason it might use more energy to go the same distance because of that.

What is actually happening is that VW is improving both the e-Golf and the GTE. However, neither car is cheap to build or buy. Joe Public may be much more interested in a cheaper mild hybrid which saves money on fuel and does the 'silent and fast pulling away' trick.

There are lots of moving pieces, so it is guesses, but my guess is donald is closer to what will happen. Lots of unintended consequences and a heck of a lot of industry, government, single issue, lobby group and individual vested interests clashing.

E.g. (just thinking on a keyboard here) we will see trials of short road trains of trucks on public roads (maybe in USA, maybe Canada, maybe India), then the UK. There is a shortage of HGV1 drivers here and in the USA. The road trains will be more fuel efficient and take up less road space. They can combine EV and autonomy (a la Tesla truck) so will take diesel trucks off the roads. At first the driver will stay, but do nothing much on motorways (except sleep, so they can get around the current tacho rules). They'll drive, but only off the motorway. The short trains will start on the inside lane and will turn out to be safe and cheaper. Insurance and road taxes will be lower for ""road train enabled"" trucks. It will be obvious there should be longer trains, but they will block exits, so the outside lane will be re-designated. Regular drivers can't share a lane with long truck trains, but cars with the same tech could. It isn't much more than can already be done. Coaches too. Now there are AV-only lanes, as there are multiple occupancy lanes (maybe only certain stretches to start with). The AV cars/coaches/trucks will have fewer accidents (very few if they didn't have to share with and avoid human drivers). The insurance on cars with certain autonomous features/abilities will go down, but also the insurance on non-auto vehicles will go up. It will be obvious that AV's don't kill or injure (many) people, nor break the law. The pressure will come on stopping humans being able to control 1 tonne projectiles passing each other at distances of 6ft and closing speeds of 120mph. How could we have ever thought that was a good idea (it will be as we now think of smoking in public places, or drink driving). In cities, as 20mph speed limits proliferate, AV taxis/buses will gain ground, starting in certain cities/countries (think China) as they will be cheaper, cleaner and safer. Central areas (think congestion zone) won't be declared human driver no-go zones but the cost of being a human driver in those zones will climb until it is effectively a ban on most regular cars.

My take is that safety is creating the push for autonomous and emissions for electric with the autonomous/electric vehicle coming into being as taxis, trucks and buses more than as consumer cars.

Eventually there will be higher insurance if you insist on old-fashioned 'driving' and tax hits if you insist on ICE vehicles. They don't need to be banned as such, just creeping cost increases combined with restrictive rules and regs that make it just not worth it. Then we'll reach a tipping point, where human driver/ICE is in the minority, then they can be legislated into dark corners, like smokers.

In an ICE where you are trying to drive all four wheels with the same motor, and have a front rear limited slip differential, I would probably agree.

With an EV, where you have a separate front/rear motor, not so much. If you design a car like the Model 3 to be AWD, then for the RWD version leave a hole where the front motor and gearbox should be, slightly retune the front suspension to suit the reduced weight at the front, and make adjustments to the stability/traction control software, what's the compromise ? The shift in weight balance would be negligible deleting the small front motor versus the heavy battery pack.

An AWD EV can be AWD, RWD, FWD or any variation in between in the blink of an eye as it is driving, all electronically. We don't know for sure but it's very likely that the AWD Model 3 is actually RWD most of the time - certainly during cruise, and only puts the front motor into operation when high power levels are required, or as part of stability control to fine tune the understeer/oversteer balance in cornering."

""Over 96% of VW’s unit sales so far this year have been powered by fossil fuels""
""But that’s the thing – those sales are going somewhere regardless. If VW and other manufacturers don’t cannibalize their own sales, someone else will take them. When manufacturers don’t offer a compelling electric version of their vehicles, EV shoppers will simply go to another manufacturer –and that customer is just not going to come back once they taste the superior experience of owning an electric car.""
So basically, if someone wants an EV then VW obviously want the sale, but they still have a huge mountain to climb to migrate a large volume of their sales to EV, particularly outside of Northern Europe.

It is bigger than Zoe and with 48kWh entry level battery 150PS is more likely. I think Golf GT is more comparable and you also need to add DSG - I am sure VW are comparing apples with apples. Plus you need to include nav and active display.

Anyway, all very speculative and we may need to wait until Sept before we know. Some articles are now saying entry level won't be available until end 2020.

Consider this though. In 2018 VW sold almost 500K Golf just in Europe. They are only planning to make 100K IDs worldwide in 2020, so they have to set the price high enough so most people buy a Golf. For the legacy manufacturers it really is a difficult task transitioning to EVs, which is BMW did the i3 of course. 

I have a hunch the traditional VW customer who likes knobs and switches won't like the ID anyway. I suspect it will be far more futuristic that VWs to date and perhaps aimed at the younger buyer. That might be a way to transition, because as volume increases and prices drop, they can sell more to those younger buyers."

Ref storage space there is also apparently a 50 litre compartment under the rear seats which is why the total marketed is 490 litres.

Mine came with 3/4 worn Hankook Kinergy Eco on them, also significantly cracked, (and so presumably the rubber going hard) they were terrible on cold wet roundabouts, even half throttle around a wet roundabout would send the rear into a sideways skid until the traction control intervened. With traction control disabled I'm sure I could have done a 180 without trying too hard.

The Quatrac 5's on the car now I pretty much have to floor it around a wet roundabout to get the back to let go, and it does it in a very controllable fashion where you can deliberately rear steer by balancing the throttle to help you get around the corner, vs just a complete loss of traction resulting in an embarrassing sideways skid at the back.

Tyres do make a huge difference. They don't solve the loss of traction in mid corner bumps though - that is all down to poor suspension design, as the car literally feels like it's hopping over a mid corner bump with a wheel leaving the ground.... on the same bumpy corner where the Xantia grips tenaciously and you're barely aware there is even a bump there..."

What you describe is that an EV typically has a low moment of inertia in the yaw axis, this is true, and it is a significant advantage of an EV with a centrally located battery.

Keep in mind that EV's can also have a lot of torque though, without traction and stability control a high power RWD EV would still be an ""oversteer monster"" when you put your foot down even if it was dynamically stable in other cornering conditions.

Simple laws of physics say that if you are already cornering hard then put a lot of power down on the rear wheels they will break traction and the car will oversteer, especially when that torque can be applied instantly. Traction and stability control are still needed to control this with a RWD EV."

What's happened is that joint ventures in China with big brand names will now earn those JVs EV credits. i.e. PSA, who is teamed up with Fukang, is now, effectively, already producing EVs. They launched the Fukang ES500 last month (albeit a rebranded/updated Fengshen E60).

Guangzhou 2018 : Dongfeng-Citroën Fukang ES500 - Leblogauto.com

So instead of having a massive upfront effort to perfect their own cars to achieve Chinese market penetration, they can carry on with JVs that now accomplish exactly the same outcome.

Meanwhile, VW has joined up with Juanhuai but, afaik, has not yet launched a product.

Likewise Ford with Anhui and GM with SAIC.

This is beta-testing of production lines for them, whilst still learning and developing EV manufacturing capability. As always, VW seems a little behind on this, despite their top headlines.

Of course, if they can kick off EU production quick-sharp then they could be first to the punch here, but they're already behind the curve in the biggest EV market.

If VW make the right product at the right price with the right dealership support and with the right [and credible] corporate message then I would not be against buying one. I suspect they might meet just one of those measures."

They're investing in charging networks 

It looks like they are serious, this looks like a legacy manufacturer grasping the nettle and making a decisive move .... 

So where are the other manufacturers ? Is the fact that Ford are in discussions to platform share with VW not significant ? Would Toyota, Peugeot/Citroen, Opel/Vauxhall, Fiat, Honda (their car is in a segment below) Renault/Nissan (whose going buy a Leaf if the ID does what VW say?) not be shi&&ing it ? I would imagine they are all hurriedly accelerating their BEV plans, which has to be good news ?

The table below is for German car sales. Bearing in mind this is a modular platform that can be stretched to accommodate different platforms it's not hard to see that all the VW products below could be accomodated on this platform in the future. Thats a fair few cars. So then how many people will buy a C class diesel over a BEV A4 ? Or an Astra over an ID ?

What are you going to do if you're making DSG gearboxes for VW ? And other components. What will be interesting to see is how they differentiate between the Skoda/Audi/VW/Seat versions. No hand me down of old platforms now, the core will be the same so do they offer ""services"" (pre book a charging spot a la Porsche ?) or something else.

I'm not sure I'd rush in to buy one of these early doors, think I'd sit back and see if there are any issues (and that may be one reason to consider Tesla's price premium) but surely a very positive step towards a cleaner environment and pushing the adoption of EV's.

EVs also have bags of torque, which is not easy to put down onto the road in a FWD due to the large-body dynamics tending to pitch the car back on acceleration.

It also helps with pedestrian safety because you've removed big hard objects from just under the bonnet.

Where I find this really interesting is with the claims VW are making and the impact on the competition. 

So looking back on 2018, MB and Audi both announced cars. They've not delivered them but they announced them. One has been driven by the press. And Tesla get's stick ... So we don't really know anything about either of those in real world conditions and they are both expensive SUV's that may be popular but don't appear in the top 10 sales chart above (in the UK the Fiesta is nbr 1 year after year). The I-Pace might be considered a little underwhelming, lacking in quick charging and range and again, expensive not troubling the top 10. BMW are years off. 

Tesla have delivered a great piece of engineering in the model 3 (in the US), but it's not playing in the same market as the ID.

OK, now at the more affordable end, well the Leaf's issues have been well documented, but even worse a manufacturer with experience delivers a product with flaws like rapid gate ? Not going to help persuade people to switch. Hyundai / Kona, now we're talking. If they could produce enough of them the Quashqai (a good seller over here) might be in trouble, lets hope production increases. Zoe, well the rumours of the new model (CCS, bigger platform) offer hope, but again it's not in production. 

Now you might consider this an open goal Greavsie, if VW deliver what they are saying they can they are surely going to sell every car they can make ? So potentially in 2020 in Europe you have the TM3 selling well and impacting the premium market for ICE and more importantly the ID on sale and impacting the Golf/Astra/Focus/308 etc market. Once they start spinning off market friendly SUV type bodies they could force the rest of the market to follow. 

In short, this is potentially the car that initiates the mass transition to EV, not Tesla. If they get battery supply, if they deliver efficiency, if they deliver excellent battery management, if they deliver fast charging/the network ... lot's of if's but possibly the most important car of the next decade ?"

I’m sure you are correct.

I suspect the reduced refinement is a consequence of having the front motor whining immediately in front on the firewall and the increased unsprung mass associated with the drive shafts and universal joints on the front wheels.

Given the traffic on the roads I probably haven’t ever taken it near the limits ! But even in the worst of last winters snow a set of winter tyres meant that we never lacked for traction or braking efficiency.

By contrast I used to own a 1991 SAAB 900 turbo that had hilarious levels of torque steer and could chirp its front tyres in 2nd."
580,2,2020-12-13,"I mean if it weren’t for Covid, and these were more normal times, petrol would probably cost more than it does currently.

Agree on point two, but hopefully the price premium often required to be paid in order to possess an EV will be all but eliminated in the not too distant future, and/or it will become possible for people without off-street home parking to charge more cheaply in their local area, perhaps by having some public charging within a certain area linked to their home energy bill.

In essence, EV driving is cheaper for some but not for everyone, and ICE driving is less expensive this year than it almost certainly would have been had Covid not happened."

“Diesel will see a renaissance in the not-too-distant future because people who drove diesels will realize that it was a very comfortable drive concept,” Chief Executive Officer Matthias Mueller said at the Geneva International Motor Show. “Once the knowledge that diesels are eco-friendly firms up in people’s minds, then for me there’s no reason not to buy one.”

What about the Sunderland AESC battery plant? It is building modules for 40kWh packs. AESC is now mostly owned by Envision. Nissan have a 20% stake.

AESC are also building the 62kWh modules, perhaps at Smyrna.

A new AESC-Envision plant announced in China will have an annual capacity of 20GWh.

300GWh / year is their announced requirement for batteries just for Europe and Asia.

VW's €1bn investment is far too small to satisfy 300GWh/year. 



Tesla / Panasonic have invested between $4.5 and $5.0 billion in Gigafactory 1. I've seen both numbers. My guess is $5.0bn includes Model 3 drive unit production, which Panasonic are not invested in.


Gigafactory 1 output is presently 35GWh / year.

VW's investment is roughly 1/4 of the Panasonic / Tesla plant. Assuming battery per-unit capacity improves at 10% per year and the plant opens in 2021, VW's plant will produce roughly 10.5 GWh per year. The rest of the 300GWh/year will have to come from other suppliers.

I think you are trivialising how difficult it is to set up and develop mass production techniques. It is bad enough for a new product with old technology, it is an order of magnitude more difficult to make a thing with new technology.

Imagine producing product that you sell for just a 10% margin over costs. Imagine your production line gets a weld wrong, too stiff and it cracks too soft and it creeps. You sell 10 million packs and they all fail. You go bust, your business goes bust, your whole life and every employee of your large company join the dole queue. These are massive responsibilities. It takes years to put in place a proper manufacturing line and to assure yourself of the robustness of the processes.

Since the growth of PCP-type finance my understanding is the level of debt associated with cars is big enough to worry the BoE. 

My gut feeling on timing is that there will be a significant social/business impact ahead of the actual availability of affordable reasonably ranged BEVs, and then another impact when it dawns what the combination of electric and autonomous cars could deliver.

Examples, just thought experiments, of things that could be happening pretty much now:

VW have hinted at adopting Tesla's direct sales & post-sale OTA upgrades. BMW already keep their BEVs as group stock (they aren't held by dealers). The e-Golf only needs an inspection after 20,000 miles, no servicing as we used to know it. If you were on the board of Pendragon, Vertu etc would you be recommending new multi-million £ investments in showrooms and service centres in the Q1/2019 strategy meetings?

If you were an investment banker, how happy would you be to support 5yr loans to finance factory upgrades for manufacturers of gearboxes?

As an accountant for a car finance operation, as the likelihood of affordable/workable BEVs gets to be 3 to 4 years away, how comfortable would you be with the residuals of fossil cars underwriting PCP loans? How close are we to that issue being real? Once it is real there could be a chasm between the lack of volume availability of BEV at the same time as the lack of affordable finance for legacy ICE.

If you ran Ford today, would you bet the farm on being a major player in supplying the mass car buying public with BEV, when the timescales that kind of investment requires to play out is also the timescales that will see the emergence of workable autonomous cars. At which point does the mass market for individually owned cars go away, and a smaller and very different market emerges for ""mobility as a service"" vehicles, bought standardised and in bulk by service providers such as Uber.

If you were running an investment trust and you had been exposed to the ""mobility as a service"" model, would you buy shares in NCP as a long term play on them gaining planning to re-allocate their real-estate to other uses?

I'm trying to highlight that investment decisions are taken years ahead and take into account assumptions on how things will unfold. The rise of the BEV is surely sufficiently probable that it will feature in decisions taken today. The ripples will have started to spread before the cars arrive in showrooms."

Obviously paying full price for rapids isn't economically great, but there are plenty of free/cheaper options around (moreso for us Scots at the moment) even if you can't home charge.

As for EV depreciation, it has swung back and forth over the past 6 years from catastrophic (2yr old LEAF for £8k or less in 2015/16) to fantastic (a 2017 SOUL would have cost you £20k and last year would have sold for £16k at 2 yr old) and back to about competetive again as more 40+kWh cars arrive and push down the older EV prices again. I suspect EV depreciation will be better than ICE/PHEV over the next few years.

Other running costs: most EVs appear a bit cheaper than ICE for servicing, insurance varies depending upon spec/car, and road tax is obviously in favour of EVs.

The cheapest drive is almost invariably whatever you currently own unless it is unreliable or a 6 litre V8. Depreciation+fuel cost of new cars is almost always greater than the depreciation+fuel cost of an older car."

Industry double speak at work. Electrified does not always mean EV. It can mean mild 48v hybrid instead. These are here now as turn-key assemblies from suppliers like Bosch. The move to 48v has to come anyway as the electrical load for secondary systems on modern cars is now so large that 12v systems can no longer cope. 

Take the industry need to keep their fleet emissions below a reducing level at the risk of stiff fines for breaching targets. Is it better to sell a lot of mild hybrids and shift ICEs that reduce emissions by 10% or take a much riskier route (as demonstrated by actual LEAF sales figures) and sell a few very low emission BEVs and take sales away from existing production facilities? 

Govt need to be stronger than the car makers and push the fleet emissions targets down further and sooner in order to force the industry focus more on BEVs. Industry in transition at lowest cost, slowest speed and minimum risk for them will be maximum air pollution exposure for society."

1193,2,2018-12-23,"Enough, already with the planes. Back to the ID.

I'm not convinced. All ev manufacturers have been rightly criticised for pumping out the hype, through talk, press releases, leaks etc, long before their much-delayed products have reached market. But VW are taking this to another level. I don’t believe this is going to be available in 2020 - not a hope. There is so little information available, look at how little RL gave away in his Fully Charged video, it was no more than a vacation ad for South Africa.

Many ev manufacturers have learnt how to supercharge the timeline from design to manufacture, considerably shortening the usual timeline for new vehicles in the motor industry. I believe VW are struggling to shake off some of the old-world processes that keep this timeline lengthy.

About the only real snippet of interesting information we have is that VW are supremely confident of having an adequate battery supply. But can that be believed? If so, what gives them this confidence? Maybe their confidence stems from a MegaFabrik that has yet to be built? Maybe it’s the Chinese factory that will be built in Germany? Who knows, but lead times for this are not short.

If VW truly have this level of confidence in bringing the ID platform to market soon then tell me this. Why only have a stated target of just 15% of production being ev by 2025? With this platform being used across the VW group and coming to market in 2020 then this should totally transform the ev/ice balance. Maybe they don’t have confidence in the ev-buying public, or in their own ability to deliver. But 15% by 2025, as a stated target?

2022 - at best."
1534,2,2018-06-17,"...

Exactly my thinking as my GTE lease is up in 2020 too.

There is one thing I have read that may cast doubt on a two motor Neo, it's from an Autocar Magazine online and states:

""By packaging its electric motor at the rear, VW has freed up space within the front section of the ID, endowing it with an impressively tight turning circle of just 9.9 metres and the promise of excellent maneuverability in urban driving environments.""

So it is possible that the extra movement and position of the steering rack would make it difficult to put an electric motor on the front axle (don't ask me how that works, I'm not a automotive engineer), however, looking at the small 100hp electric motor that is stuck onto the side of the ICE block in my GTE, I think they should be able to stick a smaller electric motor in the front. 

Say the 168hp rear motor and a 100hp front motor. Put the motor bias slightly to the back (basically the opposite of the 4motion system in the Golf R that normally uses the front wheels primarily with a bit of power to the rear but can shunt the power around where necessary) and they would have a 268hp insta-torque rear biased EV monster. Articles already say the car should be getting rear multi link suspension so it should be able to handle the extra power with some slight suspension and steering adjustments.

Also VW say the ID Crozz should have the drive and steering characteristics of the Golf GTI with it's two motor setup (but being taller they probably have more space for the front motor) but its all the MEB platform so I see no reason why VW could not deal with it and use the two motor software they will develop for the Crozz in the Neo.

I really hope VW take this seriously and does not water down the potential of the Neo just to sell more ICE cars. They could have the formula to make the VW Neo GTE the new Golf GTI of the EV era."

Well, EV's solve the weight balance issue by having a heavy battery in the middle and the weight of the motor (whether at front or rear) being largely irrelevant.

But that's only part of the solution - it's modern electronic traction and stability control that has made RWD safe for the average punter who is used to driving forgiving FWD cars. And in theory, EV's can do a better job of traction and stability control due to the superior response time of electric motors (instantaneous torque adjustment) and in the extreme case you can have an individual motor per wheel to give torque vectoring, something that is not really possible with an ICE.

RWD makes a lot of sense for EV's in a way that it didn't for non performance ICE cars. 

However if cost is not a factor, AWD is king of the hill for EV's as you get all the advantages of AWD but without the disadvantages of ICE AWD such as prop shaft and power wasting limited slip centre differential."

2383,2,2016-12-14,"The 'mild hybrid' is simply an oversized alternator on a belt drive. When decelerating it will create electromagnetic drag on the engine/drivetrain, and it'll give a belt-delivered boost when accelerating and for quick start.

The old Honda system is a true parallel hybrid (parallel hybrids cannot be run with a stationary ICE unless clutched, which is not necessary on the Honda system) with a large motor on the flywheel. Contrary to your impressions, there will have been times driving it when the engine DID stop operating, though it had to carry on rotating. The valve control would decompress the cylinders and they'd just flap around but do no work (neither decel nor accel).

You probably noticed that it was a very quiet car for an ICE. That's because the times when an ICE would have been more noticeable, the ICE in your Honda wasn't doing anything but rotating.

I really like the old Honda system and have considered buying one as a stop-gap between cars in the past. Might still do.

Also the 5 miles here and 10 miles there and dropping kids off at school then off to swimming lessons etc etc mean awful fuel economy.

The main issue for us is that the family wagon also doubles up as holiday / weekend away transport so to go down that route it would NEED a range extender. Yes I know that you can charge at rapids and it's a small price to pay for that couple of times a year that you do these sorts of journeys but to put it another way, anyone with a young family will know that the worst part of any family journey is the getting them in and out of the car and time sat there in the car waiting is usually argument time with the associated heightened tensions.

Again it seems that usage profiles are not taken into account, something with a smaller battery for perhaps a realistic 100 miles range and a beefy range extender for longer journeys would suit the people carrier profile much better, rather than hauling around a massive battery for the 90% of the time it's potential is not being used. - Basically an much enlarged i3 REX would be perfect !!"

I have to argue with you on that! 

They're more expensive than a Leaf, grant you (but make up for that in the depreciation), but until the 30kWH Leaf came along they got about the same range if a bit more (an issue soon to e addressed); while anyone who has test-driven both will say that the driving experience is qualitatively better.

The GTE is certainly an attractive proposition, granted, and I almost got one myself. But given that it is the EV mode that all PHEV drive talk about and seek to optimise (and are often disappointed by how little they get), I didn't see why I should pay extra for much lower electric range..."

1011,2,2019-03-19,"VW have been really clear repeatedly that the Neo will be priced very close to the current Golf range. I expect the First Edition to have a decent level of kit (but not everything) with the mid-range battery offering somewhere around 250 miles. 
In exchange I expect VW will want somewhere around £25/£26k - The final price really has a lot to do with the value of the pound and possibly tariffs. As it stands, clearly there's a whole hill of uncertainty in the UK between now and September.

I believe the only similarity between the Neo and the Kona is that they both have an electric drivetrain and battery. They occupy 2 different sectors and 2 different market points. Hyundai is not on a level with a German car manufacturer in terms of quality or brand perception. They're not trying to be 

Furthermore having sat in a Kona and watched Bjørn Nyland's road tests, I have to say the quality of the interior plastics don't excite me and the road noise is, well, noisy. 

There's appears more interior space in the Neo than in the Kona with a larger boot and more space for adults front and rear. 

Also, VW will be building the Neo as either rear wheel drive or all wheel drive. I believe this is really important in an EV - With 100% instant torque off the line, some front wheel drive EVs scrabble around for traction when floored, or when moving swiftly out of junctions. Being pushed along from the rear is better than being dragged along at the front.

I suspect when the full range of trims and batteries is launched next year, that the smaller battery (200ish miles WLTP) in basic trim with rear wheel drive will be priced at just on £20k, the mid range rear wheel drive at £25 and the all wheel drive largest battery car will be just shy of £30k, perhaps a little more. 

My wife drives a total of 40 miles on a working day, around 50 over the course of a normal weekend, 160 miles on a round trip to the in-laws and anywhere up to 4,000 miles for holidays if we were use her car to drive to Southern Spain or Germany.
She simply doesn't need a 300 mile range EV, and we don't want to pay 300 mile range money for a car that will be underused. 

For that reason, if I'm close to being right about the Neo lineup, we and others will be able to choose the car that best fits individual needs. 

With the pre-order and delivery dates a little clearer now, I think we've decided we'll be ordering both the Neo and a Peugeot e-208. 

The Peugeot will arrive first and will mean we can take advantage of the margin we have in the 2016 i3 94Ah Rex that we bought at the end of its lease in August - At the moment there's a window where these particular i3s are holding their value, caused by their having the longest battery range of an i3 with the added petrol generator, and BMW discontinuing the Rex in the latest 120Ah i3 with it's only slightly improved electric range. 

If we don't sell the i3 in the next 6 months or so, I reckon the launch of these new EVs (Neo, Corsa, e-208, DS etc) with better range, more modern tech, 5 seats etc will chip away at the BMW's value. Plus the warranty expires in August just as its first MoT is due. That's a redline for us with an EV.

If the Neo's pricing is as we think it will be, we'll cancel the Peugeot order and go with the Neo. There probably won't be many e-208s so we don't want to miss out on that in case the Neo doesn't work financially. 

That said, we might have the Peugeot, keep it until next year when the normal mid-range Neo becomes available (or something else) and flip the Peugeot."

2315,2,2017-03-01,"Just picked up this quote on the battery implementation on the Hyundai Ioniq from this article:

2017 Hyundai Ioniq First Drive | Edmunds

""Leaving Lead-Acid Behind

The lithium-ion batteries of the Ioniq are located underneath the rear seat, which frees up space for the cargo area and puts the battery weight lower to the ground for favorable handling and stability. Hyundai also did away with the conventional 12-volt lead-acid battery, building it into the same underseat lithium-ion stack. This alone saves 26 pounds, according to Hyundai, not to mention the chunk of space where the clunky conventional battery would have lived.

So what happens if you leave a dome light on and accidentally drain the 12-volt battery that's buried under the seat? Well, there is still access to the 12-volt battery's positive terminal from under the hood. But the Ioniq hybrid goes one step further and features a brilliant battery reset button in the cabin that enables you to jump-start yourself using the bigger lithium-ion pack. That's right, you can now resurrect your own car battery with the push of a button. And those hybrid batteries will always have juice due to their programmed charge strategies.""

It sounds like a superior implementation with the better use of space and ability to self jump start using a reset button in the cabin if needed. I hope to see something like this on VAG cars in the future."

There is definitely a hierarchy regards VAG interiors, in descending order it’s Audi, VW, Seat and Skoda. 

But, there is a certain amount of overlap between them and it all moves on with each model refresh, with them all getting a little better than the last time, but Audi generally getting the latest materials. 

The last car that genuinely excited me interior wise was my original Mk1 TT, but that seems dated now. 

I get a lot of Hyundai, Kia and Ford hire cars, brand new and often high up the range, and whilst not bad places to be, they always feel a little lower rent than the VAG interiors even if they have more lights/screens/functionality. 

I agree though that VAG interiors are quite conservative (even dull!), if long lasting, and would like to see something more exciting going forward."

Although, I don't recall VW pitching it as a luxury car like the Phaeton used to be, it's aimed at the executive segment rather than luxury cars like S class or 7 series. I was considering a nearly new one before covid hit, as they used to depreciate rather savagely. 

Yes, the driver assistance tech on the Arteon was most impressive when I drove it, but it's sad to hear that it's not that great from your real world experience. I have to say that some manufacturers do have driver assistance tech that works very well in the real world without false alarms or slamming on the brakes for no reason. Toyota, MB, Volvo and BMW are the brands I've driven the most with driver assistance tech that has worked well. 

I appreciate it was challenging circumstances due to lockdown when you were shopping for a car, but the moral of the story is that test drive the exact model before you place an order. I made a mistake once on leasing a new car for 2 years that I had not test driven. I had test driven an older model locally and I mistakenly assumed it would be similar in terms of driving characteristics, but it wasn't and I was stuck with the car for 2 years.

VW have had to spend time and money developing tailored maps for each model since the scandal broke, and also the 1.6 diesel requires a hardware mod as well as a software update to be compliant again, and it's money that they should have spent at the time they were releasing the models. There's incentive enough IMO.

I think the 'defeat device' is no more than a clever engineer coming up with what they thought was a great idea to ensure on the face of it that VW diesels easily met emissions regs without costly software development or hardware mods. VW were locked in an arms race with BMW et al for a share of the huge fleet market at the time. Did you ever wonder how it's possible that two companies released cars with identical power and performance figures at every release?

But to suggest that somebody came up with an idea that would end up costing them at least circa $20 billion and incalculable reputational damage just so that they could change direction strategically, something that they could do anyway for lower cost and without upsetting customers or countries?

I really don't think that will happen because it would be a massive departure from how things have been done with motorways and other special roads. Legally it's very difficult to exclude certain types of traffic (eg pedestrians, cyclists, horses etc) from an existing public road, so generally motorways etc have been built from scratch with only certain classes of vehicles then allowed on them. That could be done for autonomous vehicles, but I think the scope for building such roads is quite small. We're not going to have AVs that can only operate as AVs on a few specially built roads. Banning non-AVs from existing roads wholesale is massively unlikely and I think just an unfounded fear of people prone to conspiracist ideation.

It does. Range mode while cruising in an S/X tries to use only the front motor when it can for cruising efficiency. Both are induction motors but the front one is tuned/geared for best efficiency at motorway speeds, so if you're doing a constant 60mph its entirely the front motor but as soon as you put your foot down the rear motor comes in to give you the oomph you ask for...

In the Model 3 the situation is reversed though - the smaller front motor is actually less efficient than the rear one because the front motor is induction while the rear is some hybrid permanent magnet switched reluctance design.

So to get best cruising efficiency you would use rear motor only then add the front one during acceleration.

Why they went with an induction motor at the front is anyone's guess ? Cost ?"

However, compared to my hybrid Yaris, which achieves 62-64mpg the per mile cost of 'fuel' for the EV is 50% assuming I'm charging at home at £0.15/kWh. So charging at the Instavolt/Osprey price of 35-36p/kWh is about parity. In practice I'm doing better than that because I take advantage of some free charging from an orphaned rapid and some supermarket pod points now and then. If I ever get a working smart meter my home charging costs will be much lower.

Instavolt seem a bit expensive at 35p/kWh, especially when BP Pulse rapids are often 20-25. The difference is the Instavolt and Osprey chargers do tend to work. With the way we organise ourselves at the moment the networks need to be profitable. They also need to bring in enough to invest in maintenance, repair and upgrades. Charge too little and you end up with a sea of broken and orphaned chargers. Charge too much and drivers will go elsewhere. I suspect this mid 30s price has been hit upon as striking the balance. 

I also view these more like motorway service fuel stops. I use them when it's necessary but it isn't a regular thing.

Only relevant if you are a cash buyer. For PCP purchases or leases, it's the cost of the PCP/Lease period that counts, and atm the deals on the Leaf for both 24kwh and 30kwh and much more attractive than those on the e-Golf.

Hi Tim,

I wish I had been on a round the world trip. The real (boring) reason is that around the time of the Brexit Referendum I was spending way too much time on social media and a lot of it made me feel pretty negative. I decided to cut back and focus on family and work. 

I am disappointed with current situation with my eGolf so dropped by to see if there was anyone experiencing the same issue. 

Also starting to look for another EV so coming to the best place for practical advice.

It is far more work to sell an EV, so even when the eGolf was more readily available, many were not interested in making the effort. Nissan addressed this by giving every dealership a Leaf target which they had to meet to get any bonuses.

Not disguised racism at all! How did you possibly come to that conclusion?

Of the things I typically dish out, I thought that was positively funny, but as you seem to want to push a totally untenable position by VW, let's just think about this for a moment;

In the UK there were 1.2 million cars listed for recalls. Assuming each of those shaved into a £30 VED band rather than a £130 band, for cars with a 10 year life span, that would amount to over £1 billion of tax evasion that VW has foisted onto the UK alone!

Add that to the 2 billion euros of fines in Germany alone, and $20 billion in the US, that amounts to around about 300 tonnes of gold, which is the fabled mass of riches that the Germans sent eastwards on a train to bury in a long tunnel. (Y'see, $1 billion is very roughly 25 tonnes of gold, and the legend is that the Nazis sent 300 tonnes of gold to an unknown location.)

The humour of it, for those not familiar with the story, is that two of the supposed protagonists all those years ago made declarations on their deathbeds as to the precise location of the train, sending every man and his dog in Poland chasing a ghost in 2015 .. let nothing be undone or not mentioned when there is enough money at stake!!

heh. So long as everyone can make money from it, what's the harm? This is the humour of it, that ethics mean nothing, once enough money is involved.

The sheer scale of VW's intentional criminality is the issue. 11 million vehicles. Many dozens of employees have been investigated seeking specific and deliberate evasion of the laws known to them.

I am happy to debate this with you, as you seem to want to contest the facts, but I would respectfully suggest you start a new thread about it. Let us read about VW's attempt to extricate itself from its disgustingly unethical past by making good with BEVs."

Given the factory and battery contracts are based around 100k units in ‘20 200k in ‘21 capacity to sell to themselves would be pretty limited. The incentive to sell on the open market is obviously driven by the potential fines due in ‘20/21 due to CO2 targets. 

Given that their history has been repated concepts skepticism is understandable but this time there’s test mules, PR around the business EV changes, they’ve already started releasing EV’s through Audi etc and the factories are under construction with production runs starting Nov so think it’s highly unlikely that it’s hot air this time especially when pre sale websites are already up with announced order dates for 8 May

1203,2,2018-12-23,"Looks like this forum could use some inputs collected from german forums 

Battery is going to be available in 3 sizes:
48, 62 and 82 kWh (confirmed by several sources, some of them close to the project. i would be surprised if they are completely wrong)

82kWh will not be available at first. Likely at the end of 2020 or beginning of 2021. 

The Headup Display is special, because it is much bigger than the system available in the competition at the moment. (Physically and also the area it displays on the window)
And because it will have AR features. It would not fit into any of their non-MEB cars, because it is too big and the space had to be reserved from the beginning. Which is why they are not using it in any of their ICE cars. 

The CO2 air conditioning with heat pump is also a special feature that seems to get overlooked easily. But it will improve the heat pump quite a bit. Yes alot of electric cars already offer a heat pump. But they are usually no longer effective at around -5°C and lower. A CO2 heat pump will still work much lower than that. Which should improve the winter range quite a bit. Hopefully VW will offer more details about this soon. CO2 (R744) is also much cheaper to produce and better for the environment than R134a or R1234YF. But it is not compatible and needs a new system.

At the moment everything is still looking good for a launch in early 2020 and VW would loose alot of money if they had to delay it, so i don't see this changing. Half of the factory is already being retooled for MEB cars and if they are not producing anything after they are done, it is a waste of resources. Employees are being trained for it too. 

The second part of the factory should be done at the end of 2020 / beginning of 2021 and production capacity should basically double at that time. They can't retool the whole factory at the same time, because some ICE cars are still being produced there.

VW dealers also already got (and signed) new contracts for 2020, because the I.D cars will get new sales models. Dealers will get a cut of the profit from upgrades purchased over the infotainment system, for example. This was done to give them a new source of revenue, because electric cars need less maintenance. 
You should also be able to order the car on the internet. 

Alot of people might be disappointed to hear, that it will not have a Frunk.

I'm guessing they are talking NEDC range, not real range. That puts real range somewhere around 200 to 300 miles depending on battery option. 



The interview with the head of VW's BEV group confirms an updated e-Golf with an NEDC range of 300km (186 miles). That is about the same NEDC range as the 94Ah i3. Real range could be about the same, although the lighter and smaller i3 may have more real range in some conditions.

The ICE has to be run at the same speed as the electric motor so the only advantage that I can see of the automatic is to allow for automatic downshifts to maximise recuperation. Perhaps the benefits of the mild hybrid are so negligible that is the true reason?"

Precisely. When analysing dealer profitably on behalf of the various franchise markets, it included everything - parts stock, rent, hours of labour sold, energy usage... Everything. The dealer has to demonstrate they are profitable and have a plan to sell certain volumes. The manufacturer effectively lends the money to the dealer to buy the cars they will sell. It's a really strange business.

One of the reasons I left that whole industry is that I predict car dealers won't even exist in 10-15 years time. It'll all be direct sales, subscription models, and pay-as-you-go.

Edited to add: I'm working for a business that makes booking and dispatch software for the taxi industry. We're working on ways to adapt this to automated cars. There will always be a market for private ownership of vehicles. However, if you live in a city centre, it makes no sense to own a car."

But, yes, in a way it is all part of the same compromise. To turn down NOx you turn down the combustion temperature, but a high combustion temperature is one of the big factors that makes diesel efficient. So if you have a diesel being kept 'cold' (using EGR) while a petrol runs 'hot' (being under high load all the time) then diesel loses out on that advantage."

The IQ lights do more than just corner lighting, the matrix illumination is also something pretty special and useful when following somebody down a dark road, or only turning off the individual LED modules that would dazzle the oncoming vehicle, but still leaving you with a better view of the road ahead around it.

I’ve never noticed the risk of not lighting up what’s ahead of you either, the corner lighting just brings additional LED modules into play, it doesn’t remove them from straight ahead. 

As I say, I’d be happy with the standard VW LED lighting, and I wouldn’t let the lack of IQ lights deter me from choosing a car that had everything except IQ that I wanted.

Ah, no, you see that is the specific difference. You could argue that other manufacturers 'exploited' a loophole by an over-reliance on the permitted allowance for transient operating conditions, but VW went a few (or in fact several) steps further and simply ignored the regulations, putting in place a completely unlawful control map strategy that only operated under exact test conditions. 

Once VW were discovered, rather than accept culpability, what they actually did then was to try to rewrite the same software so that it was more difficult to discover.

That wasn't enough because when one of their engineers tried to whistle-blow on that, they sacked him with extreme prejudice.

This is the difference with VW to other manufacturers; the others may have arguably 'bent the rules', a bit like 'tax avoidance', but VW simply ignored the rules altogether, like tax evasion, turned their evaded tax into gold bullion, and then tried to bury their Raubgold in a train tunnel in Lower Silesia."

1713,2,2018-06-29,"I had a gen2 Prius a fair few cars back, and an Auris HSD just before the Golf GTE. 
Both the Toyotas would quickly regen their 1.2mile battery (they used the same drive system). 
However the GTE takes ages to restore its EV battery to show 1 on the GOM, compared to them, over the same route/roads/traffic loads. (ie it's gone to zero , the ICE has kicked in ) 

With a ""full"" battery in the Toyota products, I knew I could get from a certain roundabout to home on just Electrons, of just over a mile and a small uphill. Took me nearly a year to re-learn driving the Golf to do that the same, regardless if the battery had 20 or 2 on the GOM. It did think/hope that in Hybrid mode with 20 on the GOM it would be the other way round, the GTE would handle more of a throttle pressure than the Toyotas before the ICE woke up. Nope. 

And the Toyotas had done 5-7mpg more than the GTE-in-hybrid on my commute runs when I manually put the Golf into Hybrid mode from the off ( again regardless of 2 or 20 showing on the GOM). 
Slowly I've narrowed it down, but only again by trying hard to find the sweet spots of coast vs slight pressure vs bMode. 
Long distance runs the Toyotas had even more of a gap - low to mid 60s mpg easily. 

It's as ugly as cack inside + out but I think the latest Prius PlugIn would beat all other PHEVs for hybrid-mpg and getting over an "" up to 31miles "" type claim. Good job it is so ugly , doesn't have eManager timers nor an App, & only 4 seats, otherwise it would be on my ""to replace the GTE "" list, which currently has just the ID Neo 40kWh on it.

There's the intangible green credentials and possible benefits of being allowed in ULEZ. A significant number of people do the majority of their journeys for distances under 10 miles but have some weird belief that they ""must have"" the ability to drive for 300 miles without stopping and hence feel that EVs are not yet suitable for them, but this would suit them. I guess they buy new cars ""because they can"" rather than on fiscal logic so this as a lease car would make sense.
As an example I have two colleagues with ICE who recently took out new three year leases - one had managed under 6,000 and the under under 7,000 miles in three years.  They rarely go beyond 10 miles but claim the need to be able to drive across the country at no notice (hence renting isn't an option). They think I'm the odd one doing 25,000 miles per year in an EV with ""only"" 100 miles range."

How often does it feel like it is changing gears and at what sort of speeds? In the Taycan Turbo (the only ""factory"" EV that I've been in) it is quite noticeable when it changes gear (but not unpleasant - just a slight hesitation/reduction in what otherwise is a smooth delivery of an awesome amount of acceleration) and only happens when you pass through 60 having been below 50 (it doesn't seem to kickdown below that - presumably to stop pointless changes if you happen to be oscillating around that speed)."

I assume you meant to write miles/kWh.

Also the difference is larger than you think 48kWh for 205 miles is 4.27 miles /kWh.

If the difference is proved correct that makes an interesting decision for buyers. Do you get a longer range vehicle that is more costly to run and a bit slower to accelerate as it is heavier or do you get a lighter, cheaper to run shorter range version?

I can only assume that the difference in consumption is due to the heavier larger battery.

Dealers have to make sure that a prospective buyer understands that the range in the brochure is a fantasy number in winter, driving at 80MPH with the heating set to 24C!

Today 99% of vehicles UK VW dealers sell have an ICE in them. There is no business justification for the dealer to train staff to sell BEVs.

Outside of this forum bubble there still aren't many people wanting to buy a BEV. There may be waiting lists of a few people waiting for a Kona or similar, but it is a trivial amount in reality. Just 1400 BEVs sold in November of 158K vehicles in total - market share of 0.6%

The battery store technology enhances their ability to claim that the batteries contribute to time shifting renewable-sourced electricity for more of the charging and that they are only buying renewable-source electricity.
It is actually a very good idea to use batteries to knock the peaks off of rapid charging and possibly make any unit look like a 50kW-100kW load to the local infrastructure.

I wonder if there will be preferential charging pricing for VW group cars out of this.
I wonder when we will see dynamic pricing at EV charge points?
As EV ownership increases and the numbers which do not have home off-peak increase.... shifting their charging to off-peak times with pricing incentives could be beneficial."

Although I do agree it is nice to charge when it's free and then drive away on pure EV in a PHEV, it just surprises me that somebody who once owed a full BEV, who could have rolled up at a charging point, with very little remaining range, to then find a PHEV that has completed its full charge HOURS ago, but is still blocking the post, supports this type of behaviour.
Arhhhh ....... But you had a Tesla with it's own charging network, I get it now !.
You have been a little spoilt by the brilliant Tesla charging network I guess.
You would not find anybody other than another Tesla blocking you, thats for sure.
Not somebody with their PHEV anyway.
As you are well aware, a GTE can fully charge on a fast post from zero to full in about 2.15 mins.
So, if you are not prepared to do the correct thing and return to your car after receiving a charge and move it, then do like I did !.
Don't bother plugging it in at all, leave it on the main car park.
Even after collecting a full charge on the GTE, the best you are likely to achieve in the winter in pure EV mode with the heater on etc, is about 15 miles of pure EV range.
I know this is true, because I owned one for over 4 years.
To collect that charge, it is possible that you could have blocked the charger post for MUCH longer that the just over two hours it needs for such a small gain in EV range.
You said it yourself, and he writes:- ""If you charge at a shopping centre in all honesty your not going to walk 15mins back to unplug, move the car, then go back in and continue shopping. I don't intend To be honest "".
I am a little puzzled why you did not buy an e.Golf instead ?. 
You already said the GTE would satisfy your commute in pure EV, so given the small EV range of the GTE, why did not not consider the e.Golf then.
Moving from the long range pure EV of the Tesla, then switching to a PHEV with a small range in pure EV mode that now ""Suits your needs"" is hard to understand ?.
Surely sitting on the free public charger for hours on end is more acceptable in an e.Golf rather than the GTE somehow ?. 
I do agree with you totally, if we had more chargers at shopping centres then there would not be an issue at all.
But, we don't unfortunately.
Adopting a good EV discipline and sharing the high demands of public charging posts, is something to consider when you don't own the exclusive rights to the Tesla charging network anymore.
Sadly gone are the days when you can just roll up, then pick up a long charge from ANY number of vacant dedicated Tesla chargers not being used by anybody other than a Tesla is a thing of the past now.

Other practical points we need to know concern towing with a flat battery:

Can you engage Neutral with no battery left?
Does the car then run freely? (This is the same question as Can you push it?)
In that case, how well do the brakes work? Obviously there is no servo assist, but is there enough braking effect for a short, emergency trip? Or would you have to rely on the hand brake?

Took to the dealership after two weeks (but by that time the issue was gone). Initially they told me to fuck off, all is normal, but after a quick talk to a curious technician he started his own research and got back to me with an interesting answer. Rough translation:

1. The fuel tank is pressurized (to not let the gas go stale if you don't use it for some time, as may be the case for PHEVs)
2. There is a pressure sensor in the tank
3. If the pressure goes above a certain level, the car will want to lower the pressure, but (maybe due to ecology?) it doesn't simply have a valve to release the extra gas outside
4. Instead it tries to burn some fuel
5. It doesn't show you any meaningful message, so you are clueless about what happens and what you're supposed to do
6. The car needs to do a ""full cycle"" of burning that requires going about 40 km on gas

I found that when that happens (happened to me 4 or 5 times already in 2 years) I need to go on a trip outside city and then the car is fixed for some time.

This happened to me both at full tank and 1/3 and 1/2. Doesn't seem there's any rule (I though the gas in your tank evaporates more when not full, but having a full tank doesn't help here).

Opening the tank flap doesn't help either, only a little bit of pressure is released when you open the flap.

Long story short: it sucks and unless you go out of town from time to time (I have another car for that), going to suffer"

Your dealer is talking out of his backside.
The basic issue is the efficiency that you are achieving (1.5 miles/kWh) when you need to achieve 60% better (2.4 miles/kWh). Low efficiency could be poor design, cold/wet weather or bad/overweight driving. If you can't drive more efficiently and can't accept the range in poor weather you need a different van."

Hopefully it will promote more open information to consumers in respect of data presented on efficiency.

Whilst not condoning VW in anyway, the levels of expected 'compensation' for each vehicle seem excessive and I would like to see the US conduct similar tests for all their own manufacturers before making judgement.

Normal daily use, school runs shopping etc would only be around 20 miles +/- so running battery only for the most part looks doable. But not really sure if this would makes sense or not over a full BEV."

I expect that the way VW have implemented their mild hybrid system on the Golf 8 requires the DSG box. Perhaps it’s like the GTE, with an electric motor between the engine and DSG box to do the starting and electrical assistance.

There must be a reason, otherwise why bother, unless it’s to join the ‘Hybrid’ sales train with something outside of the plugin GTE."

A 10kWh domestic battery is about £5,550 from LG without installation so that would be quite a saving as well. I can see the idea of using some of your much bigger car battery whilst it is sitting there to offset expensive daytime electricity costs is quite attractive but, I have no idea of the technicalities of how that would be made to work and clearly some technology would be needed to connect house and car bi directionally.

You might have missed the pointless point of an 'SUV'. A Land Rover with a huge flat bonnet was great on an exped for laying out a map and arranging several canteens of coffee. The fact that these will never go on exped, never be off road and certainly never have its occupants reaching for something as antiquated as 'a map' is missing the point that their owners seem to want to imagine they might be! "
1077,2,2018-12-16,"Crikey, this has caught me out ! . I spoke to my local VW dealer a few weeks ago about the iD and heard some interesting news that there would be a chance to pre order this coming April with static demo models planned to be in a few UK showrooms. I thought this news was maybe blue sky thinking by the dealer in order to keep me interested. Having seen no spy shots of car I was thinking that launch would not be till late 2020. But now we see the prototypes, with journalists driving them as well. Having just sold my Leaf 40kwh with funds in the bank I was thinking about the Tesla Model 3 but with UK prices expected to be circa £45000 ish then it might prove a tad too expensive for me. Plan B was the VW iD.

I have had a look at the interior pictures of the iD prototype car, looks a bit like a current Beetle inside, downmarket grey plastic with a minimalist dash. There looks to be some form of iPad style dash layout, the covers might reveal a single screen in front of the driver with a larger screen adjacent. I am slightly confused about the two red controllers on the centre console,they might be drive mode buttons and/or some form of idrive control. Or temporary shutdown switches for the prototype cars. The wheels of the car look huge, maybe 20 inch in size or larger.

All in all the new car looks promising and I might pencil this in as a possible next car."
1848,2,2018-03-21,"NEDC is fine, of course. It is a test for comparative purposes, and a measure of the range you could get if you drove like the NEDC cycle.

Most people drive EVs in a different way, yielding ~2/3 of NEDC in summer and ~1/2 NEDC in winter.

EPA is a measure of the energy going into the car for the mileage driven, not the energy used from the battery to the wheels. Correlation with road usage is related but 'somewhat coincidental' on that basis."

Depends on what appalls you. Our Golf GTE does 45-48 mpg running in hybrid mode on motorways with no initial charge in the battery. That's normal driving up to the speed limits, none of your hypermiling nonsense.

Since 90% of trips and 50% of mileage are on electric, lifetime mpg is 90.

Suits me fine."

1973,2,2017-11-03,"I would have to question the technicians assertion that all Golfs have run the same suspension/steering components for the last few versions.

I’ve owned and worked on every Golf since the Mk2 version, and whilst they share basic suspension and steering setup with just about every other car on the road (ie they have shocks/springs/a steering rack and the front wheels steer!), the actual components and setup are quite different across the years.

Certainly changing the front springs on my Mk7 GTE was the most technically challenging of all of them, although admittedly still not difficult.

Intermittent faults are the most frustrating, and the ones in my experience that the dealers are least able (or inclined!) to deal with. It really is pot luck if you get somebody who is technically competent to diagnose and fix an issue rather than just throw parts at something until the faults (or you!) go away."

Sounds great. I think Robert's price guess is optimistic but even so, nice write up. 

Also some confusion as the German article stated two different power outputs (perhaps 125 and 150kW) which I presume goes alongside the two battery sizes however Robert has said 180 horsepower for both.

I had a Superb iV for a while which I was also pretty underwhelmed by - it felt totally gutless and very slow to respond, even in e-mode with a full battery. Nothing like driving an EV or the Ampera I used to have. Unlike yours it did have proper buttons, but the touchscreen software was terrible (particularly the Carplay implementation) and the GPS regularly got lost.

Standard lights give a good spread of the road ... the LED lights are great and work well, but the IQ act like spotlights, moving as you turn the steering wheel .... Great to see the road as you 'turn' at low speeds, but any slight move of the wheel as you are going ahead at speed .. they risk loosing the ability to light up what's ahead of you ...

It's very much a personal choice thing .. I wouldn't pay extra for them ... but others will love them. Why not see if a dealer will give you an extended test drive and borrow a car with IQ lights over night and see what you think yourself."
