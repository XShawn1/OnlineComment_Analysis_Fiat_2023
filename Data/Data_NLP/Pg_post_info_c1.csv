0,Peugeot SatNav Questions,121771,"May 30, 2023","1. Is it possible to store my current satnav location as a destination? 

I have this in my ICE car and it's useful when somewhere I visit regularly isn't in the map database. Our gym, for example, isn't listed and when I park there, the location is called the local school sports hall, which is nearby. 

2. Am I the only one where importing contacts results in meaningless addresses?

I think it's a French thing - '18 Shaftsbury Road, Brighton' turns into '18 Brighton Road, Shaftsbury'. ALl my contacts are similaraly mangled. Is there any way to import/set the addresses properly?",0.0,0,173
1,Peugeot e208 wait times,105960,"Feb 16, 2022","Hi all,

I ordered my Peugeot e208 in December 2021 - wondering if anyone knows of wait times? I know its only been a couple of months but just excited to not have to put fuel in my current car!

2,Peugeot E-208 charging issue,98425,"Dec 17, 2021","Hi. I just wanted to let people know about an emerging charging issue with E-208. I have struggled to find information about it online.

I'm somewhat an expert now because I have had a 69 plate E208 and a 20 plate E208 which have both had the same fault.

Both occured around 10-12k miles. The car would be plugged in and would sometimes charge fully, other times it would only charge for 10 mins and other times it would charge for 2hrs. It's very unpredictable.

When charging stops the app will show 'Charge interrupted' and the car will have the white light near the charger, showing it knows the car is plugged in but isn't charging (when charging it flashes green)

If you unplug the charger and plug it back in it will start to charge again.

Peugeot will tell you it's your car charger that's faulty.

However on both of my Cars it's the 'CHARGE UNIT' which has broken. Both have been replaced under the 8 year warranty costing Peugeot around £8,000 each time.

It's a huge inconvenience and very annoying to have had it twice. There is a blog on here which is titled something like 'Peugeot E208 podpoint problem', however I can now report it's not podpoint to blame.

Anyway it's just something to look out for and suggest that your dealership check if you have the same issue, because my dealer couldn't find the fault for ages. If you point them in this direction it may make your life easier

Also make a complaint to Peugeot so they know this issue is occuring, the other blogger got £500 voucher for his troubles, my complaint is still open at time of writing.

Anyway best of luck with your cars, keep the faith (at least it's a decent warranty)",51.0,1,26384
3,Peugeot E-208 and wallbox (wallbox.com),106813,"May 4, 2022","Hi everyone!

I'm an owner of a Peugeot E-208 for about a year and I've been always able to charge the car using the schedule function of my wallbox (wallbox.com).
I have it set for some time frames that differ from weekday vs weekend and normally when arrive at home I just plug the cable and wait for the schedule to start.

Last month the car had his first revision and Peugeot told me that there was the need to upgrade the internal charger firmware as a new version was available, and since then, the schedule function of the wallbox do not work. When it reaches the schedule the wallbox goes to the status ""Waiting for car demand"" and stays like that all night. Tonight I have made a discovery, after the schedule start, if I press the refresh button on the Peugeot app the car starts to charge. This might be because by clicking the button the car awakes.

This totally defeats the purpose of having the schedule if I need to manually press a button in the middle of the night to start the charge.

Does anyone having a Peugeot E-208 can relate to this? Is there any known solution for this?

Thank you all in advance,

6,Peugeot Ion Airbag Light / Diagnostics,77360,"Oct 11, 2019","Hi all,

The airbag light is permanently on in my 2011 Peugeot Ion and it needs an MOT. I have checked with Peugeot for any recalls and there are none (some 2011 i-miev had airbag sensor recalls but seems not for my Ion). A garage had disconnected the passenger seat airbag connector to get to the master fuse, and this may be what has put it on. I understand that airbag errors stay on until reset. I have an iCarSoft i970 diagnostics reader but it says that it cannot communicate with the airbag system.

Does anyone else have an i970 and if so can it talk to your airbag system? When I do the automatic scan it doesn't list airbags, then if you go to manual select and choose airbag system it then says it can't communicate.

The car also doesnt really seem to like the i970, it makes the dash go a bit crazy ! Is there a better reasonably priced diagnostics reader for the Ion? I have CanIon which is great but looking for something with fault codes. If I can't work it out then i'll just take it for the MOT and see if they can reset it, but would rather work out if I need a new airbag controller before then.

Cheers all !

She has never let me down or given me cause for concern. She’s done just over 52k miles, no issues at all flagged on her last MOT in December, has had her Takata airbag recall work carried out, and has never given me any hassle. She has had one previous owner, and with me has been used as an only car and daily commuter.

3kw onboard charger and Chademo rapid DC, bluetooth stereo, USB port and the usual kit, the original remote central locking keyfob and a traditional spare key, and comes with the original 3-pin ""granny"" charging cable, mennekes cable and all the original paperwork (manual, service record, receipts, folder etc.)

She has had a generic screen washer bottle installed to the replace the original.The drivers side front tyre needs a top-up twice a week (I've got a small 12v tyre pump that'll go with the car). In the past she had a car park shunt, which caused minor cosmetic damage. This was tidied up professionally. No mechanical worries at all. Never had any in all my time with the Pug.

Overall, a fantastic little EV and I'm going to miss her. Not the most modern thing around these days, but she is a total tardis. The back seats fold completely flat, and there is hardly any boot lip, so the cargo space is incredibly useful for a car of the size. I've done a full house redecoration and clear out and also helped a relative move house whilst she's been my only car.

17,Peugeot e-208 Charges at 95kW,74132,"Mar 18, 2021","Got the chance to put the e-Pug through it’s paces today, for the first time since I got it! I had to make a 270 mile return journey. (M11, M25, M40 and A40).

The consumption seems to be improving with the rise in temperatures. On the outward journey it managed 3.5mpkWh, and a slightly better 3.6 on the return leg. Only got slightly better than that in a Zoe ZE50 on a run to Cornwall last August.










I was planning on charging at a CYC rapid at my destination. Arrived to find BP Chargemaster swapping the old unit out for a new Ultracharger. Never mind, I’ll try it out next time. Hopefully it’ll be as reliable as the old one. 

Where I was really impressed was with the charging speed. In preparation for the return journey, I charged at an Osprey 50kW Rapid for half an hour. 20% to 75% at an average of 49kW. I then did a splash and dash at the new Ionity chargers in Beaconsfield Services. The peak of 95kW didn’t last very long, but I added 18kW in fifteen minutes, so an average of 72kW.










The 208 is a much better motorway cruiser than Zoe. You can easily keep up with traffic, and the steering doesn’t feel too vague. The car feels stable at motorway speeds, without the signature Zoe body roll. And last but not least, I find the seats very comfortable with no aches or pains at the end of the day!",27.0,2,4846

Mine has had a rattle at the front every since buying it although it seems to have got a lot worse in the 3500 miles I've done since then. Primarily at the front left but both sides I think.

They only rattle over certain types of rough/broken road surface but are very noisy when they do rattle, far noisier than any front brakes on any previous car I've owned. Pressing the brake enough to engage the friction brakes silences the rattle completely.

It's so bad that if thump the front left wheel rim with my hand I can hear the brake caliper rattle - confirmed by holding the caliper with my other hand while thumping, which then silences it. The caliper seems to have a lot of play in it, although I haven't had time to take the wheels off and have a proper look at it to see if it has anti rattle shims missing or what is going on.

It also sounds like the front droplinks need replacing too, which is a different kind of noise, more like a click, over something like a step in the road, but to be honest the brake calipers are so noisy I won't be able to isolate the other noise until I get them sorted first!

36,Peugeot iOn long journey report,4795,"Feb 9, 2020","I bought a 2011 Peugeot iOn with 39000 miles on the clock from a fellow Speakev user yesterday. While its main use wiIl be as a second family car for a 16 mile round trip commute and ferrying about young people (therefore range is not that important from day to day), I had to collect it from Doncaster and drive it back home to Glasgow (around 250 miles). Since there may be an interest in the range and usability of a 9-year-old small EV of this kind, I thought I would summarise the experience which was, overall:


about what I expected in terms of realistic range at motorway speeds
slightly better than expected in repeat rapid charging - the rate of charge seemed to hold up and I was not aware of battery heat being an issue (albeit it was wintry and the iOn doesn't actually have a battery temperature gauge).
I am a fairly experienced EV driver having had a Leaf24 since 2015. I don't think this journey would have been possible in 2015 because the rapid charging networks now are simply far more comprehensive than they were then.

I left Doncaster at 2pm and reached Glasgow at 10.40pm therefore this was hardly a fast journey but, thanks to Zap Map user comments and the availability of double rapid charge units at 20-40 mile intervals most of the way, at no point did I fear not making it.

While the stormy conditions yesterday were not nice, the southerly wind was in my favour from the point where I reached the M6 onwards. I had the air on but not the heating, to save electricity. This made it a cold experience aided only by cups of tea.

Leaving Doncaster with 100% battery, stops:

Instavolt Leeds York Road Halfords (arr 30%, dep 60%)
Instavolt Ilkley Booths (arr 30%, dep 73% ish, battery seemed to cut off at that stage)
Engie near Settle (unplanned - just a few minutes top up to ensure I reached Kirkby Lonsdale without a problem)
Instavolt Booths Kirkby Lonsdale (left with 74%)
Tebay Ecotricity (arr 35%, dep 67%)
Southwaite Ecotricity (arr 15%, dep 75%)
Gretna Green Polar (arr 30%, dep 80%)
Moffat Chargeplace Scotland (arr 24%, dep 76%)
Abington Ecotricity (arr 25%, dep 78%)
then home 37 miles later with low battery warning flash.
I drove at 45-55mph most of the time. This was not an imposition on other road users because the stretch from Doncaster to Kirkby Lonsdale was on A-roads where 45-55mph is a typical driving speed and the M6/M74 was dark, stormy and quiet.

I might have got away with charging less often (the Leeds and Settle stops were more for reassurance and I might have made it to Rheged rather than both Tebay and Southwaite) but it is best not to take chances with an unfamiliar car in wintry conditions.

If you are prepared to use any and every rapid chargepoint (rather than stick to one provider), use Zap Map responsibly and favour sites with 2 rapid machines wherever possible then such long journeys are doable if a bit extreme in an iOn.

Since this is Speakev, I will round off by having a go at Ecotricity. Three consecutive service areas from Carlisle to Moffat (Todhills Northbound, Gretna and Annandale Water) were marked as broken or of serious concern on Zap Map therefore that area of motorway would have been unusable for a short range EV if it were not for other providers' A-road chargepoints nearby at Gretna Green and Moffat. I found greater availability of rapid chargers on A roads than on motorways for this journey.

While this was fine as a one-off journey, I now look forward to the iOn remaining in Greater Glasgow for the duration of our ownership.",2.0,5,1665

Kingston upon Thames (Surrey)

AirCon / Tinted rear windows / BlueTooth phone handsfree and iTunes streaming from iPhone etc.
Very good load space (for the car's size) with rear seats down
Included is the standard EVSE 3kW 'brick' and also a 5m Type to Type 2 cable.
Also has the wind/rain deflectors on front windows from Micks Garage, and which you'll see on the forums are quite popular with iMiev / iOn / C-Zero owners - but these can be removed in 2 seconds if not required.

Best range achieved was 90 miles on a charge last summer in London
Worst experienced in winter was 55 miles.

The only minor bits are:
1) Hole in front driver carpet when I got it but you wouldn't know as there's rubber mat in top
2) A couple minor chips concurrent with age,
3) A very minor 'push' in on rear hatch where some kind 4x4 must have touch-parked, but you have to look to see it and it was probably there for ages before I even spotted it.
... but don't be put off - these are both tiny things and it looks very nice.
4) Needs a new spigot for Rear Drivers side recline handle to slide onto, but recline still fully available by my improvised handle!

I'm the 3rd owner:
1st was AirportServices company DNATA
2nd was a car dealer who bought it from Blackbushe Car Auctions last year but didn't understand EVs and who sold it to me within weeks!

No Service History, but as an ex fleet car I must assume that this was all done during that period: I moved heaven and earth to try and find out from DNATA and from Peugeot but BOTH said they were not at liberty to divulge the information (even though I was now the registered keeper).

40,Peugeot e2008 - Touchscreen Software Version,90227,"Feb 16, 2021","Hello everyone,

I was wondering if owners of the e2008 are getting any more updates on their Peugeot app. I remember doing an update immedtiately after I got the car back in August. But nothing more since then. The Tom Tom got two map updates, I had done one immediately with the touchscreen update back in August and another one maybe one or two months later can't remember. Nothing more since then.

I'm asking because the Peugeot app here is not officially supported in Malta and while I can use all the features, I'm wondering if it's a case of no available updates, or if these are ""hidden"" for me because I'm based in Malta.

Good day everyone!",5.0,1,4944
41,Peugeot iOn Fault,4108,"Oct 27, 2022","I have had a 2012 iOn since 2015 and it's been great.

This Sunday I was out in a big storm.

The car now won't start. Specifically, it turns on, I can put it in Drive, Reverse etc but it won't move. It says D or R (or N or P) are selected but it won't move.

In neutral with the hand brake off it won't move when pushed. 

It feels like the brakes are on, full on.

I have regreased the gear linkage as once or twice before, the gears were difficult to select when that hadn't been done.

Does anyone have any ideas. My very unexpert view is that if I could move the car a few inches forward or backwards then things might work.

49,Peugeot Ion EVSE,15953,"Mar 27, 2017","Hi All,

Can I just double check that the EVSE that comes with an Ion is rain proof while operating upright, provided that the 3 pin plug is plugged into an outdoor waterproof socket ?

I'm pretty sure it is by looking at it, and if it wasn't it would make it a bit difficult to use, as the total cable length is nowhere near long enough to reach an indoor socket! (And yet the instructions say not to use an extension lead....yeah right!)

As I don't have a dedicated charge point yet (still trying to figure out how much that would actually cost me with the OLEV subsidies and wildly different prices I've seen quoted online) I had been temporarily running a 15 metre extension reel out through a small window from our back porch, sitting the reel and the EVSE in the boot of the car then shutting the boot carefully over the cables. (If you put the cables either side of the latch there is enough give in the rubber to not crush the cables) Not ideal, and very tedious rolling everything up and putting it away every day!

So as an interim measure I've mounted the EVSE vertically on the outside wall of the house about 2 feet above ground level plugged into an outdoor waterproof 3 pin socket and cable which is run back along the eaves and into the back porch in a waterproof way via the sky lighting. It plugs into the same socket I was using before which is on a circuit that is only shared by an unused socket in the garage and a washing machine. The cable is a heavy duty 13amp outdoor extension rather than the 10 amp indoor reel I was using before.

No more rolling and unrolling a reel and throwing a cable through the window, no more shutting the boot on the cables, I can just drive up, grab the Type 1 connector off a hook I mounted on the wall and plug in in seconds.

Convenience and cable clutter wise identical to a dedicated tethered point. Assuming the EVSE is actually waterproof! (It is sheltered, but a strong wind would blow rain at it)

Also I'm really struggling to get a clear idea of what the cost might be including any subsidies for a Tethered Type 1 16 or 32 amp dedicated install, (the Ion can only make use of 16 amps, but depending on the cost difference I might stump for a 32 for future use on other EV's) as I consider my EVSE wall installation only temporarily and I'd like the extra speed and reliability of a dedicated tethered charger install.

Anyone have any pointers on that as well, mainly from a cost and logistics point of view ? And I assume most people favour tethered both from a theft and convenience point of view ?",0.0,0,1543

51,Peugeot Ion 62 plate for sale,4020,"Mar 31, 2016","Hi All,

I have been on the side lines for quite a while, so I thought I'd give the forum a chance to purchase a white Peugeot Ion we have for sale. 

We are a electric car only family - we first started with a Leaf (Wife's car now), then the Peugeot Ion, and now a BMW i3 rex.

The reason for the sale of the Peugeot Ion is that the BMW i3 is a company car and I no longer need the Ion.

I bought the Ion in Sept 2015 from a main Peugeot Dealership (before I knew about the company car option in January 2016 - I now have to travel further for work hence the i3 rex). They had it up for £6495, but I paid £6000 outright with no finance. It is a great car and has been perfect for my commute to work, around town and easy to park .

The Ion comes with an MOT until 18.09.2016, and warranty until 20.09.2016 (subject to a £25 transfer admin fee to Peugeot.)

Car has done 18900 miles (I did over 1000 miles in the car)

Condition is very good inside and out, with only slight wear and tear of a 3.5 year old car!

We am based in Stroud, Gloucestershire.

For sale £5,250 ono. 

A great electric car at a low price, maybe get someone started with an EV car before a Tesla!

If you have any questions, please do not hesitate to ask.

Cheers

53,Peugeot E-Expert 75kw LWB Van,110185,"Jan 27, 2023","Good morning,

My partner has just switched to a Peugeot E-Expert 75 kWh Van from the Nissan E-nv.

I am posting here as I can't see a Peugeot area on the forum.

We are just getting used to it, how long it takes to charge etc, and so far things are looking good - the range from the 75 kWh battery in particular seems to be holding up quite well in the cold weather compared to the smaller battery of the E-NV. The E-NV also had a really small load space and wasn't particularly practical for what it was used for.

The E-NV needed a top up charge most days in the cold weather to get home but the E-Expert has managed without. Only down side to this is that it needs a good 10 hour charge overnight, every night, so a good chunk of the charge is on peak rate. It does avoid expensive daytime fast charging though so it is still more Economical despite this.

We haven't yet calculated its real world range of combined city and countryside driving, so I am looking forward to getting that calculated.

Positives so far are a really good usable load space and a reasonable range in cold weather.

Downsides so far are that the Peugeot App is a bit rubbish, and no rear parking sensors on the base trim despite it being quite a long van.

Anyway, I am interested to know others experience of the van - we haven't had it a week yet so still getting used to it.",2.0,2,460

Hi all - in these uncertain times maybe the thought of a cheap small EV is attractive?

I am selling a 2011 Peugeot iON in silver with 86,000 miles - I am the third registered owner. I have only had it a short time and am only selling as I’ve been offered a work vehicle - which is not an EV unfortunately!

It’s an excellent small car that nips around town and fits into the smallest parking spaces. in many ways it’s similar to a Mini or even a Smart car but it has four doors and with the back seats down there is fantastic load of space. It is a 9 year old car and so isn’t perfect but the bodywork is very clean and interior is good for age of vehicle.

While the NCAP is said to be 95 miles range, this would I suggest have been optimistic when new - it is a very efficient EV (compared to some of the larger models), but I would say it has a real world range of between 45-70 miles dependent on time of year weather, terrain, driving style use of heater A/C etc. At this time of year, you should expect towards the lower end of this. Compared
To other small cheaper EV’s this particular model has an ace up its sleeve, in that it rapid charges via CHADeMO which with a small battery means that when you do need to charge to 80% SOC is pretty quick. (Over 80% the charging speed slows down - this is how it was designed)

It’s in very good condition throughout and drives faultlessly. it comes with two charge leads one type 2 to type 1 and a granny charger. I haven’t used the latter and it does look a bit the worse for wear.

I have loads more pictures I can provide if requested.

I have priced this to sell quickly and I’d be surprised if you can find any EV cheaper than this.... please don’t make any silly offers. I am in Wiltshire.

Il share what I think would improve the car its just things that could be fixed by a software update I'm sure.

Would be good to change the estimate time remaining to a percentage like 80% 
Also it should have the current charge speed in kW not just ""miles per hour""

I understand this is related to the main capacitor not charging up within the specs that the EV-ECU says it should. Below are a few screens from Hobdrive that may be of use.

The myimiev forum has plenty of info regarding potential component failure within the MCU circuit board (and the small hybrid board) that could cause this issue.

My thoughts were that I would be best to have the circuit boards tested to see if any of the common component failures were present or not. I've tried a couple of places here in the Central Belt of Scotland, but none have been willing to give it a try. 

So, can anyone recommend a good testing place reasonably local to me (Livingston)?

Or are these components easily testable using a multimeter?

86,Peugeot Ion not charging with high mains voltage,15953,"Mar 1, 2018","Here is one for @Grumpy-b @donald and other EV guru's whose names escape me for the moment to muse over....

I got home after driving in sub zero blizzard conditions and after doing a successful rapid charge earlier in the journey only to discover that my Ion was refusing to Level 2 charge on my Rolec charge point. 

I would plug it in, the red charge light would flash but then the generic warning light (yellow car with an exclamation point through it) would come on and after a few seconds it would abort with the Rolec opening it's contactor. It was doing it every time I tried.

The only other charge problems I've had at home with this car in the year I've had it was a problem with the gear lever not sitting quite right in the park position due to the cable needing lubricating, but it wasn't that as that was causing the fault light to stay on all the time.

First thought was ice in either the plug or socket (as it's -3C and blizzard like conditions with icicles hanging from the cars bumper...) which has been reported on here before but they looked OK. I grabbed the granny charger and tried that - same problem. At least the Rolec is eliminated as a culprit...

With no real leads to go on, heavy snow still falling and me wanting to get inside for the evening I grabbed my Diagbox laptop and scanned for fault codes, and was presented with this, which I confirmed came back after clearing and attempting to charge again:










AHA! I rushed upstairs and grabbed a 3 pin voltage monitor and plugged it in on an unloaded circuit to monitor the house mains voltage - 248v. Technically still within spec but that is pretty high, normally it's pretty consistently around 242-244 volts here and I don't think I've ever seen it go above 244 volts before.

I tried turning the electric shower on which pulled it down to 243 volts - success! The car now charges. Phew!  I decided to experiment a bit further with different sized loads to find out where the threshold was that the car refused to start charging.

A toaster's load dropping the mains to 247 volts was not quite enough to help but a 3.6kW kettle was enough to pull the house voltage down to 246 volts and successfully start a charge. So 246 volts or less it is happy, 247 volts or more it will refuse to start charging.

Once started I was able to turn the kettle off and it still continued to charge, however because the load of the car itself charging was 3.6kW and able to hold the voltage down to (just!) within its acceptable voltage range, I don't know whether the voltage test is done once at the beginning of charging, or whether the voltage rising to 247 volts would abort a charge that has already been in progress for a while...

If the latter that is very concerning when you might come out in the morning to find the car stopped charging due to a night time voltage peak! 

I'm very surprised by this after a year of flawless charging (apart from the gear lever park position issue) but I guess in that whole year the voltage has never strayed that high.

Everyone is home from work since yesterday due to the red snow alert so if I had to guess I would say that there is a heavy load on the circuit in my street that has resulted in the DNO bumping the local step down transformer up to the next tap to avoid voltage sag, with the result that when the load is light the voltage is higher than it's ever been before the current crazy weather conditions.

The question is - why can the car not charge at or above 247 volts when the mains voltage in the UK is allowed to go as high as 252 volts ? That seems to be a pretty serious shortcoming if you ask me! Was the car properly tested for type approval in the UK ?!

Are there any other EV's that suffer from being unable to start a Level 2 charge because the mains voltage is on the high side but still within acceptable UK limits ? 

Could this be an explanation for some of the inexplicable failures to start charging on public charge points that some people have reported ? Who knows what the mains voltage is at some of the commercial locations where charge points are located...!

Edit: It occurs to me that this thread might be of more general interest if other EV's are likewise affected so if a mod wants to move it to the general charging discussion area of the forum please feel free to do so.",26.0,1,8064
87,"Peugeot iOn, 2011, 30.5k miles, for SALE",102408,"Jan 9, 2022","Hello, to everyone!

Peugeot iOn, 04/2011, 35 kW, 49 000 km, (30,6k miles) is for spare parts or repair (was intended to be my first EV car, but unfortunately it seems that it is not to be the case)

Long story short:

I have found a Peugeot iOn on an action as a non-driver with an electrical malfunction P1A15, then did a research on the web and thought ""what a great opportunity to dive in EV world (was wanting this a long time now) and learn some new skills by fixing it!"" So, I bought the car.

And it arrived.. And to my great disappointment it appears that at some point it has suffered a body damage by a tree (it seems to) falling onto its rooftop... It was fixed very amateurishly, but enough to not be able to see it in the pictures of the advertisement.

To perform such a body repair (rooftop, both pillars) with the resources that are available to me would be economically ineffective gently speaking.

So right now, after the sourness went down, I have decided to sell it for repair or to part it out since the drivetrain and electrical parts (except fault code P1A15) are in good condition.

I am not in car's parts business so the best-case scenario would be to sell the entire car as it is at once and just to try to get back at least the money I have paid for it.
Which will save the lots of time and effort to deal with parting it out, though it could even bring some profit considering electrical components prices alone.

The car has a completely new 12 v Battery: ""BOSCH 0 092 S40 180 12V 40Ah 330A (bought for diagnostic purposes since the original was dead.)
I have made some diagnostics of the battery pack and attaching some screenshots and pictures of the car. (LEFT HAND DRIVE)

So, if someone is interested in this offer, please PM me and we can discuss other details or more pictures.

Or contact me via email: [email protected]

Or if you know someone who can be interested in this Peugeot or in parting it out, please share this ad, I would be extremely grateful!


Price: 3500 € (~ £2900)

P.S. I Will kindly offer my help to find a transportation option to all continental Europe.

90,Peugeot Ion 2012 plate - Is the Main battery dying?,89060,"Jun 25, 2020","Afternoon
I got my pride and joy Ion in 2014 and have had almost bang on 6 years of absolutely hassle free driving with it since then. Although almost 18 months old when I bought it, it had been sat in a garage car lot so I was the first owner.
The last two weeks have been an eye opener though. It started with an amber warning signal - Car with a spanner through it. At thate point I more or less stopped driving it - apart from to take it to a local garage who have been doing the MOT's and were happy to do me a diagnostic. This threw up a few codes U1100, U1920, P1B18, U1100, U1922, P1AA7, U1113, P1A02 are the main codes.
The local garage advised they have not got the skill set needed to identify what these codes mean or to undertake repairs so I began to try to find a garage that would. 

However since then another issue has arisen. When I start the car I am now seeing the Gear Position letter on the dashboard flashing as soon as I put my foot on the accelerator and if I go above 10 mph the dreaded tortoise symbol also appears. Part of my issue is that as I live on the East Coast of Scotland about 25 Miles from Edinburgh I am a bit stuck in terms of who is around to repair an EV. I bought the car on the west coast so cannot get it back to the original dealer who sold it to me although I am trying to get a franchise garage on this side to help me with it. They are a bit reluctant to support as they say they do not have EV trained staff although they are a Peugeot Dealership.

So my two questions to the Forum Members 
1) Has anyone had this problem with their Ion or equivalent EV Car and are these codes telling me that my Battery Pack is now dying or could there be another explanation? I had the 12v Battery checked and that is ok .
2) Is anyone aware of a garage or preferably a mobile EV trained mechanic that operates in the East Lothian area that they could direct me too?

I'm reluctantly selling our 2011 Peugeot iON which we purchased just 4 months ago. The reason for selling it so soon is because I bought it for my wife for her daily commute to work and she has resented me ever since because I sold her Peugeot 307 which she loved 

I really only purchased it test how well we could cope with an EV vehicle and it has been such a great success that we're now upgrading to a Leaf (with all the bells and whistles).

There is absolutely nothing wrong with this car and it has only covered 13k miles, I personally love it and I drive it as much as I can. It is quite basic but that makes it simple to drive, it has auto headlights, folding mirrors, bluetooth radio and climate control A/C.

It has a valid MOT until November 17 and it qualifies for no road tax! It has a part service history with 2 stamps in the book, one in December 13 at 7268 miles and the last one in March this year at 8559. The next service is due in March 18 or 18k miles whichever comes first.

It can be charged at home with the included power brick and takes about 7 hours or will charge to 80% in under 30 minutes using a Chadamo rapid charger.

We purchased the car from Howards Peugeot in Yeovil and it came with a 1 year (valid until March 18) Peugeot Gold warranty which can be transferred to the new owner. They used it as a demonstrator and when we received the battery report I found it had never been rapid charged in its life! We have since rapid charged it around a dozen times.

The battery is still healthy and the car will cover up to 70 miles if the conditions are right, or 50-60 miles in nearly all other circumstances.

We're in Dorset and I welcome any viewings/test drives. If you're not local I will assist as much as I can to get the vehicle to you and I can be flexible if needed.

I'm looking for £4650 for the car, this price reflects the great condition the car is in and the low mileage for its age.",5.0,0,1825

97,Peugeot Ion issues with EO 22KW workplace charger,101078,"Nov 12, 2021","Hopefully the title is self explanatory, but we have a new (to us) 2012 Peugeot ion which refuses to work with the EO chargers at my office. Supposedly these are 22KW and they are non-tethered Type 2 connectors which I am using with a Type 2 to Type 1 lead.

I appreciate the car only has a 3KW charger, but I have used the same lead on other public charging points (e.g. Pod Point) which are 7KW and it charges fine, but obviously only at the 3KW rate. It also charges fine from the Granny Lead at home. 

With the EO charger it seems to connect ok (lights flash, the car shows up in the app as connected) but the light on the charging station never changes from flashing green to solid green and the car doesn't charge. 

I have tried with another brand new Type 1 - Type 2 lead so it's not a fault with the lead itself so far as I can see (although I guess it may possibly still be the wrong type).

I just wondered if anyone had come across this and whether it's a known issue (for example 22KW charger is too much for the car to handle etc.)?

99,Peugeot Ion -- do I really need to pay €6894 for a repair? 😬,94698,"Feb 16, 2021","Hello everyone.

Some advice, please!

I have a (much loved) 2011 Peugeot Ion.

Recently the car stopped mid-drive, and the yellow ""!"" car warning light appeared on the dashboard. The car restarted and we were able to drive home. But now the car won't charge, the warning light stays on, sometimes the car will drive for a few meters but then stop, sometimes it won't drive at all.

The local Peugeot garage took the car. They replaced the 12V starter battery. This did not fix the problem.

They say they have run some diagnostics and are convinced that the ""electrical convertor"" has failed and needs to be replaced at a cost of €6894.

I am not 100% convinced that their mechanics know anything about the Ion, or indeed any electric cars. I worry there may be a much simpler, cheaper solution that they are missing. Before I consider paying this much money, does anyone have any alternative solutions?

103,"Peugeot Ion Battery charge question, not sure where I should be posting as new here",112096,"Jul 6, 2022","Hello all, 

I purchased a 2014 Peugeot Ion the other week with only 4,000kms on the clock, it is in pristine condition. I dearly love it and it is perfect for our needs.

the problem we found on day one (after an overnight charge on the house socket charging at 8amps) is it will not charge fully (I only get an 80% reading) and the yellow car with exclamation mark warning light lights up intermittently on the dash, sometimes while charging, sometimes while driving. Because we had only just bought it, the person we bought it from (trader) paid Peugeot to run a diagnostics test and the resulting problem and cure for them seems to be a complete battery pack replacement at a cost of 16,000 Euros. 

I am returning to the seller next week and he has the codes from the diagnostics. (seeing he paid the bill)

So, I am here to pick your brains if I may. 

I'm not going to even enter into a discussion on the battery replacement with the seller as it is way way way more than the cost of the car, so that is out, but, when charged, the car still allows 81kms of range which we can at a stretch work for us but the top 3 bars if they illuminated then those extra kms would have been such a cherry on the cake. 

I know this may all be a moot point as I am yet to find out the fault codes but I wanted to ask here if I should re consider walking back and handing the keys back to the seller and walking away from the deal which is right now my only sensible option right? right?

I'm not sure if anyone has had the fault of not having the battery indicate anymore charge than 80%, I haven't as yet been able to find anything in this realm online. 

I have seen people online suggesting all sorts from the ability to replace individual cells within the battery pack once the failed ones have been discovered (if that indeed is the problem in my case) 

I'm sorry if this all seems like a random waffle but I'm just wanting to see if there are any opinions out there giving me another angle to think about. for example.. if the batteries are just deteriorated but not in the area of just giving up completely while driving but will continue to charge to 80% for many years to come (of course i understand this can only be an assumption as with any vehicle) then I would consider going back to the seller and asking for some price reduction or such like. 

I don't know batteries but if this helps, this ION i bought was part of a fleet which had the lowest mileage, (the highest was over 130,000 kms) my simple assumption was this must have been kept near the head office and only used rarely but was it left on charge all the time and was it left on charge on a fast charger and is that why the battery won't now charge past 80%

If you got here on this, my first foray into forums then thank you for reading this. I'm happy to answer any questions but as you can see from above I have not fully elaborated on everything, If I did this would probably have a hardback cover and need to be in print. hahaha. 

Thank you all for your time and I hope someone can help.

The front badge will be gloss black and the ridiculous ‘208’ emblem will removed as it has no relation to the e-208.

The rear badge will be gloss black. I’m thinking about plasti dipping the Peugeot lettering in Matt black but my sprayer guy said it will peel off so I might completely remove the lettering.

Just joined the forum today.
Just purchased a second hand 2011 Peugeot Partner Teepee S HDI this morning for our business.
Very excited but rather anxious as I have never owned EVs before...
Never realised how difficult it is to insure a converted EVs! I have so far managed to get ONLY ONE insurance quote from Adrian Flux for £700 fully comp which is much higher than what I'm used to paying for a car insurance (currently paying £250 for fully comp)
I'm trying to get another quote from Graham Sykes but before they can quote me, they are asking for some technical specs for the car. I've searched online but no luck so far....
Does anyone know;
1. Peak power
2. 2min rating
3.Continuous power rating
for the 2011 Peugeot Partner Teepee S HDI?

Your input is much appreciated

I'm considering acquiring a troublesome Allied Electric Peugeot Expert, as they seem very plentiful!

My plan would be to use the Motor & battery pack, but replace the BMS, inverter & DCC etc, the finished van would need to be 100% reliable!

A few questions 

1. Has a project like this been done before? what are the pitfalls?

2.Is the AE inverter reliable? most problems seem to be with the BMS on here, - Can the inverter be used with the AE BMS removed? or does it get upset because its BMS friend is missing?

3. Do you know the voltage applied to the motor? (If new inverter required)

4. Do you know of a compatible BMS that would work with these vans?

I've got a load more questions, but I'm new here and don't want to impose too much!

Thanks!

134,Allied electric Peugeot Boxer battery issues,39505,"Jan 16, 2019","Hi everybody even after reading all that's been said about Allied Electric vehicles, ive just gone ahead and bought the Allied Electric Peugeot electric van that's been on ebay for the last few months with under4000 miles, on the clock.
I bought the vehicle without viewing from I believe a reputable trader, and its now arrived on a trailer.
After 5 yards it conked out even though the battery charge state was showing 72%, owning a couple of Edison Ford Transits, I immediately assumed the low voltage circuit, I had been told it was fitted with a new battery, but just in case I put it on charge, only took a few amps it was fine, just managed to make it roll to my 3phase supply and hooked it up. Seemed to charge up to 100% in approx. 3 hours? but it was still taking 20 amps when I switched it off, where as at 90% on my Transit it has generally gone on to one charger it has (4off,) and goes on and off for an hour for the last 10/15%. Whilst this was going on, I attempted to read the data stream from the OBD plug, but my transfer software is for CNC machine tools, and although it streams its garbage, so ive now ordered more software. Checking the vehicle over, i couldn't help noticing how clean and well oiled the main battery pack mounting bolts were. I contacted the sellers with my misgivings and observations, and they now inform me, that the battery pack has indeed been removed and several cells replaced, and I have been assured, once I charge and discharge it a few times the BMS will sort it all out.
Once charged the vehicle seemed to drive fine and I completed 3 miles flat out in short bursts up and down a private road, as I am reluctant to swap over my insurance at this time from my Transit, as it will probably be going back. I will wait till I can get the battery pack info before I make any decisions, but I doubt that a few cycles will sort this out. Because its such a narrow band of enthusiasts that get involved in such undertakings, has anybody else seen this vehicle, and can shed any light, and let me know their findings. Because of my ignorance in electronics I actually went and bought a damaged Nissan E - NV200 van to take the Transits place, but apart from a mountain of work, after buying the thing, I found out you can't fit a towbar, to these things, and I had hoped to be sprinting an electric motorcycle this year, and at 9ft plus it wont fit inside the ENV hence I bought the Peugeot. Why don't I just keep the transit, its a fridge van with tons of insulation and fibreglass, and I need to remove the bulkhead to get the bike inside, and although I have recorded 76 miles from her in summer, its only a 36kw pack, and the Peugeot is 55kw and I can also stand up inside, seemed an obvious choice????????????.

My current lease is going to end in June and I am considering going for a EV. Would be getting one through a salary sacrifice scheme (looking at £200 for a BMW i3 all in or a Peugeot 2008 for £250) So would use the EV for commuting to work (round trip of 18 miles four days a week and the odd trip out for about a round trip of around 100 miles once a month) So looking at the ranges of both EV's the BMW is about 160 on a full charge and the Peugeot is about 190, so I am thinking that the ranges should be okay for my needs?

I have some questions around owning and charging a EV.

Looking at the ranges of both the EV's I am looking at, would they cover the distances I am currently driving?

Has anyone got a 2008/I3 what are they like on a daily basis?

I live on a terrace street with no off road parking,so unable to have a charging point installed, but if able to park outside, could I use my home plugs to charge if needed during the day while at home as long as the lead is not in the way?

Been looking at the different apps used to find charging points and not sure if it's possible to use just charging points around my local area to keep the EV topped up, is this something others do? And if you do, is it easy to keep the EV charged?

I have a solar trickle charger, is this something I could use to keep the battery topped up?

In terms of charging, what are the costs? Looked a Polar Plus and they charge around £8 per month, what does this cover?

How do the different charging companies/points work/charge?

What about stopping at say Lidl and using their charging points without going in and buying something? (That goes for all places that offer charging points)

Oh yeah, only have about a week to make my mind up before picking a car and currently EV's are the cheapest option for a lease (Currently paying £280 for a petrol Seat Arona)

Its been repaired by an independent garage for basically the cost to fit a new bumper from mitsu and is good as new and MOTd. New front conti ecocontact6s and reasonable new ecocontact5s on the rear (a few thousand miles ago). It is completely standard. It does around 55 miles in summer with careful driving. Due to the category S marker (even though its perfectly fine, I can share photos of the damage and engineers reports) I was thinking around £4500.

Any interest on here before I list them in the usual places?

Both cars are white. Photos to follow soon. Located in Leamington Spa, UK

155,Digital service records / Peugeot App / Main dealers,99685,"Jan 6, 2022","I purchased my e208 in October '21 as an 18 month old car (registered March 2020). Had a low mileage of 4k miles and a stamped service book (1st year 12 month service when it had 2.8k miles) from a Main Dealer not local to me but not too far away - maybe 40 miles or so.

All well and good - and as a March 2020 car I assumed it would need it's next service in March 2022.

Clicked the ""Vehicle check"" button the other day and it said Service due in 3 months or 11,000 miles - so all good.

Looked in the Peugeot App and it gave me some unintelligible timeline with a red cross next to where a ""first service"" should have been undertaken at 4,800 miles (It's now done 4,900).

I called my local Peugeot Main Dealer (2 miles away) and asked what the situation was and if it's due a service at 4,800 miles (I recall reading somewhere that there was an issue whereby 8,000km was used as a service interval) or if I am ok to wait for March.

The local main dealer confirmed it was due a second service in March 2022 (brake fluid service apparently for 294 quid all in) but in order to set that up he needed all the vehicle info so he could add the car to their database as currently it didn't show up on their systems. I said that it was serviced by the supplying main dealer at year 1, but he said that as they were a different chain of main dealers he had no access to any of the vehicle records and couldn't tell me if the first service had actually been done or not or if any recalls were needed or had been done.

I thought the whole point of digital service records and connected car Apps was that all this data was now available to (at least) main dealers and proper independent garages and that this was a selling point for digital service records so that you couldn't get scammed with dodgy service book stamps etc.

What's the point of having all this data stored digitally if the app doesn't match what the car needs and the main dealers can't see each others records? The app certainly doesn't seem to be able to show me any service history (Should it?)

I love the car - but find the App to be pretty hopeless.",4.0,0,2967

160,adding the Peugeot wiring loom kit to the e-208: possible?,106341,"Feb 25, 2022","Hi,
I am planning to use my Peugeot e-208 to carry bicycles on the hatch door.
Thule has recently approved some models for the e-208 and 208, so that is great.

However, Peugeot has no approved wiring loom for the e-208, only for the 208, and insists that loom is not compatible with the e-208. So they won't install it. And in New Zealand, it appears there are no alternative aftermarket products available. No technical reasons given for the incompatibility.

Does anyone know what the problem here is? Why does Peugeot not approve the wiring loom, which is legally required here when carrying bicycles, so that a light board can be mounted.

I'm puzzled how complicated things are in New Zealand, and how easy that is in the UK for example.

This is a fault with one or more of the internal poppet valves. These are not a common part.
I have now worked with MES to obtain spare valve parts for these pumps, and can offer a repair service. If it is a vacuum switch or motor fault, Im afraid its not possible to repair, at the moment. I cant obtain those parts.
The Allied uses a 3 wire version against the C1 which uses a two wire version . 
If you have a C1 and are desperate give me a call as I do have some refurbished stock I can use on an Exchange basis, but with a very heavy upfront deposit. People have in the past not sent the exchange part back, and left me temporarily with no exchangeable item. Hence the replacement part cost = deposit
Cost including 48hr Parcelforce carriage and VAT for a repaired,tested working unit is £45, bank transfer, or £46.50 Paypal. Expect a 4 day service, or I can use 24hr Parcelforce at an extra cost.
You send the part to me, I check it out. If repairable, I send you a VAT Invoice, once paid, I send it back. If I cant repair it, I can send it back at your cost / choice.
I only use Parcel force for smaller items as I have had losses with HERMES in the past. Its a pain if that happens.",0.0,1,1024

There's not much info on the web or the official website (dealer knew a little but not a lot, and this is Peugeot UK!) so thought I'd ask you owners a couple of questions.

I read on a review sight that it only charges to 80% via Chademo but you can restart the charge to get to 100% but it does it very slowly, is this correct?

Does it charge to 100% on the type 1 socket or is that the same?

What is the speed of the type 1 socket, is it just 3.5kw or does it charge faster from a wall charger?

170,HELP! My Peugeot Ion Inverter has died: cheap solution???!,19041,"Mar 8, 2017","About three weeks ago the orange warning light came on and my 2011 Ion would not go into ""ready mode"".

I took it to the local dealership who told me that the water heater needed replacing. £1,700 later, I drove the car away only for the same orange warning light to come back on two trips and 5 hours later, with the same refusal to go into ""ready mode"".

Having had it recovered to the same garage I was told that the invertor had gone, and that it was pure coincidence that this happened immediately following the problem with the water heater. To have the inverter fitted will be over £3k with a significant delay as it will be on ""back order"". I only paid £5k for the car!

I am hoping that there is either some cheaper solution, or that I can at least get some of my £1,700 back, as the coincidence in time of the two faults does seem rather odd.

181,Wanted: your broken Peugeot Ion / Citroen C-zero charge unit,77360,"Oct 3, 2019","Hi all,

Summary - if anyone has an i-Miev/ion/c-zero with an issue anywhere in the UK that I can use for parts let me know - 07763 749769.

Fully story -
This might sound like a strange request but bear with me...

I have a Peugeot Ion that has a very early charge unit. These early chargers did not use the normal granny cable EVSE with ""brick"" that is used today but instead just had a cable that plugged into the power and the car. You can see an example of this here at approx 2m40s





This charger is basically dumb, i.e. you put power to it and it charges at a fixed rate. If you plug in an EVSE it does not know the car is there because the car's charger is not communicating via the pilot signal (thin red wire in the charge cable if you've ever taken one apart!) so charging never commences.

When you give the charger 240v it draws 12A, at 120v it would draw 8A but that isnt particularly useful. There is no simple way to make this charger draw a slightly more sensible 10A @240v. 12A is really too high to draw from a 13A plug for any period of time, the plug gets very warm. I've tested charging for an hour or so on a cold day and it works but is not safe for regular use.

To make this car usable safely I am going to install a 16A caravan socket in my garage and caravan plug on the charge lead, then I will be able to safely charge at 12A and use the car, however this is not ideal as I can't charge at relatives houses when I visit and just reduces the usefulness a bit.

So, if anyone out there has a broken charge unit from any of these cars (or i-miev of course) then please do let me know. I would then attempt to upgrade the onboard charger so that it does communicate via the pilot signal, or use parts from my charger to repair the broken newer one and make the car communicate with a standard EVSE and charge at 10A.

Thanks all !

191,Eek! First long trip coming up from Brighton to West Wales. Advice welcome!,96619,"May 24, 2021","Hello! This is my first post here. 

Next Monday we are due to drive from Brighton to Fishguard in West Wales. It’s the first time our Peugeot e-2008 has gone further than a 40 mile round trip since we got it in Jan. 

According to ZapMap we should only need to recharge twice along along the 307 mile journey. 

I’m not convinced! 

Just to make things even more gnarly, it will be a heavily laden car - 2 adults, 2 kids, 2 dogs and 1 roofbox.

We have a home charger (so we aren’t very familiar with public charge points). 
Any advice for total newbies would be really appreciated! What do we need, what should we bring? How often do you think we will recharge? How can we be certain charging stations are actually working? Is it ridiculous to think we should stop overnight en route?!!

All of the basic questions!

Thanks in advance for any and all help.",56.0,0,4808

194,I tested side-by-side Kia e-Niro <> Nissan Leaf e+ <> Peugeot e-2008 <> VW ID.3 1st. Here's what I think,93079,"Nov 22, 2020","Hey all, 

I tested these cars for our electric taxi service and I wrote a piece on it for Electric Vehicle Universe newsletter (check out EVUniverse.io) that I'll also share here. 
These below are purely my own opinions and I hope to offend no-one. Happy to discuss any of these more in-depth and would love to hear your opinions too!

Cars in the test: model, (battery size)

Kia e-Niro (64kWh usable, 67.1 total)
Nissan Leaf e+ (56kWh usable, 62 total)*
Peugeot e-2008 (45kWh usable, 50 total)
VW ID.3 1st (58kWh usable, 62 total)
* That's our newest addition to our own fleet of 91 Nissan LEAF's

Introduction
I'll keep it as short as possible, so I'll bring out the best and worst of each. Keep in mind, that our point of view for these was the possibility for taxi-usage and really subjective. Since the prices vary, we won't touch on that. You can check the specifications of each car from EV-database.org.

Peugeot e-2008
Best feature: outside looks. It does look stunning when you see it driving towards you. Makes you smile.
Needs improvement: for the life of me, I couldn't find the battery state of charge % anywhere. The objective guess-o-meter (range estimate) is definitely not the best thing to use on an EV, especially if you don't know how it's calculated exactly.
From the 4 cars, we were least impressed by the e-2008, as it doesn't really seem like an EV-friendly car, rather just a gas car made electric. Even Fully Charged said it's a transition car - we agree.

Kia e-Niro
Best feature: inside looks. Overall, it looked a bit more lux than others and it's driver's seat left the best impression to most of us.
Needs improvement: Back seat room. Our 186cm colleague had his head against the ceiling. It's a very 'normal' car overall, that has most of the features LEAF has and some more. Would be cool to see the front get a new facelift like Kona did.

Nissan LEAF e+
Best feature: overall practicality and space. We've had 91 LEAFs so far and comparing it now to the other cars, we realized: Nissan has the most ""everything important covered"" points so far. It looks luxorious enough, with plenty of room in the back. Also the trunk size is the best from all 4 (although Peugeot's specs were bigger. That's a surprise.).
Needs improvement: the least effective by Wh/km. It is our range test results so it might not be the same on every condition, but so far the LEAF proved to be the least effective.
In general, we saw that LEAF still proves to be one of the best EV-s in this market.

VW ID.3 1st
Best feature(s): it's born to be an EV. Similar to the LEAF, ID.3 isn't based on a gas car - and this gives it an edge. I love the interior design on the infotainment part - it doesn't have a lot of buttons all over the interior, most of it is in the ""tablet"", much like in a Tesla M3. The rear-wheel drive gives a lot of fun to the drive and boy did we love to ride around with it. Also - there's way more space in the back seat than you'd guess from looking at it outside. The 186cm colleague didn't have any problems in the back of the ID.3.
We see ID.3 as the only real contender to the LEAF from these four.
Needs improvement: The only real nudge towards improvement is the overall looks of the front interior part - it looks like a lot of plastic and a bit cheap. It might be better on a black interior though - we'll see.


To us, the winners here seem to be the VW ID.3 and Nissan LEAF. But of course, the use cases are different - to each their own.

We are still deciding on which cars to go with - do you have any ideas on why some of these would fit or not fit to use in a taxi service?
