The lack of other options might be one of the saving graces. I don't know about Stellantis, but where parts tend to arrive asynchronously a lot of companies will no hold one part while waiting for another if they have an order that would not have to wait is they were to use that part now.

Mine was in the dealer for a week, I had to take it home and keep unplugging it then plugging it back in for 4 weeks though whilst the part was delivered.

Surely Peugeot must be looking at this and finding a long term fix. I assume all the stellantis cars have the same issue, such as Corsa and Mokka so this is going to cost them a fortune long term

Hi. I just wanted to let people know about an emerging charging issue with E-208. I have struggled to find information about it online.

I'm somewhat an expert now because I have had a 69 plate E208 and a 20 plate E208 which have both had the same fault.

Both occured around 10-12k miles. The car would be plugged in and would sometimes charge fully, other times it would only charge for 10 mins and other times it would charge for 2hrs. It's very unpredictable.

When charging stops the app will show 'Charge interrupted' and the car will have the white light near the charger, showing it knows the car is plugged in but isn't charging (when charging it flashes green)

If you unplug the charger and plug it back in it will start to charge again.

Peugeot will tell you it's your car charger that's faulty.

However on both of my Cars it's the 'CHARGE UNIT' which has broken. Both have been replaced under the 8 year warranty costing Peugeot around ¬£8,000 each time.

It's a huge inconvenience and very annoying to have had it twice. There is a blog on here which is titled something like 'Peugeot E208 podpoint problem', however I can now report it's not podpoint to blame.

Anyway it's just something to look out for and suggest that your dealership check if you have the same issue, because my dealer couldn't find the fault for ages. If you point them in this direction it may make your life easier

Also make a complaint to Peugeot so they know this issue is occuring, the other blogger got ¬£500 voucher for his troubles, my complaint is still open at time of writing.

Anyway best of luck with your cars, keep the faith (at least it's a decent warranty)

I‚Äôve lived with this issue pretty much all of last year (got the car late 2020), and took quite a while to realise it wasn‚Äôt my home charger but actually the car. My dealer finally replaced the OBC (on board charger) at the end of 2021, it took 6 weeks to arrive into the country as has to be made and programmed to the VIN of your car. Within 6 weeks of the new OBC being fitted it has started to behave in exactly the same way, dropping out midway through charges after between 30-120 mins of the charge starting.
The car is at the dealer now and they are speaking with Peugeot technical but I have no confidence they know what they are doing and will probably request another OBC to be fitted.
We are trying to reject the car now as had so many issues with it.",2,None

The error message disappeared if the car was switched off for a few minutes. I took the car to Robins & Day for diagnosis and they claimed to have fixed the problem, but it began to recur shortly afterwards. Then, on a trip to Brighton at the end of August all kinds of error messages began flashing and then the power steering packed up completely, making the car almost impossible to manoeuvre. Luckily I was not moving fast: I don't know what the consequences might have been if it had happened on the open road. Back to Robins & Day: four week wait for a diagnostic appointment, after which they told me there was a fault on the main battery charger which would have to be replaced. After a month's wait they told me the wrong part had been delivered. I finally got the car back last weekend, after nearly three months. I agree it is a lovely car to drive (and looks great too) but it is a concern that there appears to be a known fault that Peugeot are not really addressing and I am concerned that my three-year warranty will expire with the problem still unresolved.",0,None

Hmm, I think someone else gets the credit here, my post was about charging suddenly stopping for no obvious reason.

I would not be at all surprised if a public EVSE offering 2 Type-2 sockets labelled 22 kW does charge-limiting to 11 kW/car when 2 are connected, or some combo adding up to 22 kW total. I'd actually be very surprised if it boosted the total to 44 kW, as that needs a much beefier supply. This load-balancing happens on Rapids as well, there's a load of new ones around that do 120kW, and are meant to support 2 EVs simultaneously, but haven't yet been 2-car enabled as the drop to 60 kW would be embarassing & lead to loads of complaints!

Hi everyone!

I'm an owner of a Peugeot E-208 for about a year and I've been always able to charge the car using the schedule function of my wallbox (wallbox.com).
I have it set for some time frames that differ from weekday vs weekend and normally when arrive at home I just plug the cable and wait for the schedule to start.

Last month the car had his first revision and Peugeot told me that there was the need to upgrade the internal charger firmware as a new version was available, and since then, the schedule function of the wallbox do not work. When it reaches the schedule the wallbox goes to the status ""Waiting for car demand"" and stays like that all night. Tonight I have made a discovery, after the schedule start, if I press the refresh button on the Peugeot app the car starts to charge. This might be because by clicking the button the car awakes.

This totally defeats the purpose of having the schedule if I need to manually press a button in the middle of the night to start the charge.

Does anyone having a Peugeot E-208 can relate to this? Is there any known solution for this?

Thank you all in advance,

Bruno

This is not a solution for several reasons. First one is that it only allows to configure 1 charging start hour. On weekends I have multiple schedules with the Wallbox.

I have another example on why this issue is should be a priority - This just happened and I'm really angry:
Today I have arrived at home with my car only having 14km of range, it started to charge at 1AM. A few minutes ago (around 3:15AM) there was a power outage that lasted 5 minutes (really rare these days I know, but they can happen).

When the power returned guess what happened... The Wallbox status was ""Waiting for car demand"". I needed to get dressed, go downstairs only to unlock and lock de car so it could start charging again. How would I go to work tomorrow if I was not awake at 3AM to notice the power outage? The battery would not be charged...

This issue is not only about schedule, it can also create impact if there's a Power Outage during car's charge.

I don't know what I can do more... I created a ticket on Peugeot website and they have forwarded to the local Peugeot center. I need this to be forwarded to their engineering team, not the local dealer...",1,None

How to fix the charging sessions schedule loop bug? (iOS app release 2.34) - Wallbox Academy

My app is updated to the latest version. This also happens when not using scheduled tasks

After spending 2 hours downstairs plugging and unplugging the car I think know I understand exactly what happens.
I don't think this is a Wallbox problem but a Peugeot firmware problem. This is problematic for this specific wallbox for how it behaves.

Let me translate the error into one phrase: If an unlock and lock action is demanded from the charger while the cable is connected and the car is sleeping, charge will fail (car red light turns on).

How I have figured this out:

Using the charging box (slow) that came with the car:
While the car was charging, I have unplugged the Power Cable from the wall and waited for the car to go into sleep mode (handbreak light inside the car is off).
Plugged the box into the wall.
Car starts to charge normally

During this process, the CCS port from the car NEVER unlocks or locks while the car is sleeping.

Using the Wallbox:
Simulate Power Outage and no scheduled program in the wallbox (charge immediately):
While the car was charging, I have turn off the main switch breaker for the wallbox and waited for the car to go into sleep mode (handbreak light inside the car is off).
Turn on the main switch breaker
During the startup process the wallbox demands the car the unlock the CSS port and since it's programmed to charge immediately it demands the car to lock again to start the charge.
The car CSS port turns red indicating failure and it do not charge.

Scheduled charge in the wallbox:
The charger is connected to the car and the car is locked (And CSS port locks too). Wait for the car to go in sleep mode (handbreak light inside the car is off)
When the schedule time arrives, the Wallbox demands the car to unlock the CSS port and lock it again to start charging.
The car CSS port turns red indicating failure and it do not charge.

I was able to make the wallbox charge when the car is sleeping by doing this:
While the car was charging, I have pressed the Pause button in the wallbox app.
Waited for the car to go into sleep mode (handbreak light inside the car is off).
Pressed the Continue button in the wallbox app.
The car starts to charge normally.

What was the diference with this process? Similarly with the test using the charging box that came with the car, there was no unlock and lock process when the car was sleeping, and therefore no failure was indicated.

Of course the schedules issue might be fixed if the Wallbox don't send the CSS unlock and lock, but again, I don't think there's something wrong with the wallbox, this is an issue with the charger firmware from Peugeot that can't deal with the fact that an unlock and lock action is demanded while it's sleeping (and the cable is already connected).

Just a note: I have also tested connecting the charging cable from the wallbox while the car was sleeping. It started to charge as expected so this only happens when the unlock and lock action are initiated with the car sleeping and the cable already connected.

With this information I will try to see a workaround with homeassistant using the Wallbox API by starting the charge and put it on a pause state. Something like this:

Automation 1:
Trigger: Car starts to change
Condition: Not in schedule
Action: Pause Charge

Automation 2:
Trigger: Schedule arrives
Condition: Charge is Paused
Action: Continue Charge

This is a stupid solution but might work. This way I'm not scheduling anything from the wallbox and will only send Pause and Continue commands.",0,None

but it‚Äôs the car that‚Äôs not allowing the wall charger to start the car charging no?

The car is the part of the system that determines when it can take a charge

so if the car doesn‚Äôt recognise the wall charger pushing a charge then that makes sense as how does the wallbox determine if the pack is suitable to take a charge?

if your phone charger was the thing in control of pushing power into your phone then it wouldn‚Äôt last v long - the phone draws charge

The car has instant and scheduled mode.

On instant mode the car should not control the charge, just take it.

And it actually does. See above the example when I use the charger that came with the car, it charges when in sleep mode.
See also the example when I use the pause and continue function on the wallbox, it also works, and the car receives the energy.

The issue here appears to be the fact that there's an unlock and lock action from the charger.

This was working when I first received the car, the issue is only happening after a firmware update of the onboard charger.

I use homeassistant to check the car state from Peugeot API (See below). You can clearly see that the charging status is ""Failure"". I need someone from Peugeot to investigate this further.

I think you will find that so last centenary! My Go went up to 7.5p months ago and is 15p from yesterday That is 3 times in less than 6 months.

I do wonder about Octopus's strategy with Go. By squeezing it all into 4 hours it encourages householders to extract a huge amount of electricity in a short period, e.g. car, washing machine, dishwasher, house battery. This is pushing the consumer unit and main fuse to dangerous limits in some houses. I have to limit my house battery and car added together to 32A to avoid overloading one circuit.

Surely it is better to be more like Economy 7 that gives more hours that are not all the same 7 hours across all customers? So can spread one's loads out to limit the peak.

From 4.30 to say 6am is also a period when Octopus surely wants to dump some excess?",0,3313580

Are you sure you're on Go at 15p/kWh off-peak? All the active tariffs I see give Go/4hrGo Faster as 7.5p and 5hr Go Faster as 8.25 

Go Faster does spread stuff out, not sure why that isn't rolled into the Go as the default. You could then select preferences of starting time. Intelligent Octopus has the widest range (6+ hours), but Octopus then have some control over when the largest single load is scheduled.",0,3321655

Hi guys.
I recently bought a used 2011 Peugeot iOn with 25K Kms on it (now it's closer to 30K since I have it). Yesterday I bought a bluetooth obd to measure the battery state and it reads 36.7Ah... now I know theoretically when new, the battery should be 48Ah, I doubt this value its real, but if it is it means my battery lost about 23% over the years.
What do you guys think, is this an acceptable value for a 11year 30K Km car or I should be concerned?

Grab Hobdrive and install the latest beta.

Yes, considerably - but actual distance was about the same per charge (around 28km/charge) and the guessometer was now relatively accurate instead of grinding to a halt with 5-10 km left showing (and claiming 70km when initially charged)

Richi: Yes, it actually does command a DBCAM and results in the vehicle's reported CAC changing.

There are a lot of UK cars in this state. They've spent most of their lives attached to charging posts but when they've been driven they've been utterly discharged. The result is degraded packs but not enough cycles/miles to recalibrate themselves. Mine had clearly never been serviced as at 90,000km the reduction box oil was black, stinky and gloopy, as was the cabin filter and the brake fluid was contaminated with water

range per minute is not very useful measure, because it uses guessometer logic. Charger at the bottom of a mountain in the middle of a journey to the top of a mountain, and you get very different results to reality.
I'd be far happier in an actual measure of power going into the battery pack (ie. kW), or even a percent state of charge per minute.
The Peugeot e-208 is much more efficient than the Audi, but it's nowhere near as good efficiency as most of the Kia/Hyundai range or even Teslas or Nissan Leafs.",0,3263258

That's not normal.

I can lock and unlock mine freely while on charge either from the Type 1 socket on the right or Chademo on the left without disrupting charging. (I do this on a daily basis without problems)

In fact you can even turn the key on as long as you don't turn it to ""ready"" without disrupting charging. Something is not right with yours as locking and unlocking the doors has no bearing on charging...

Hi, LTO was only for Japanese domestic market Mitsubishi only.

If this is a true late 2012 model Ion, it should be a 80 cell LEV50N battery pack (Lithium ion upgraded electrolyte). Any.buyer should establish exactly what is for sale.

The seller also reports that one of the front wheels needs pumping up twice a week. IMHO this makes the car unroadworthy and should be addressed before the sale goes through .(new valve, tyre, rim etc required ????).",0,2424202

Got the chance to put the e-Pug through it‚Äôs paces today, for the first time since I got it! I had to make a 270 mile return journey. (M11, M25, M40 and A40).

The consumption seems to be improving with the rise in temperatures. On the outward journey it managed 3.5mpkWh, and a slightly better 3.6 on the return leg. Only got slightly better than that in a Zoe ZE50 on a run to Cornwall last August.

I was planning on charging at a CYC rapid at my destination. Arrived to find BP Chargemaster swapping the old unit out for a new Ultracharger. Never mind, I‚Äôll try it out next time. Hopefully it‚Äôll be as reliable as the old one.

Where I was really impressed was with the charging speed. In preparation for the return journey, I charged at an Osprey 50kW Rapid for half an hour. 20% to 75% at an average of 49kW. I then did a splash and dash at the new Ionity chargers in Beaconsfield Services. The peak of 95kW didn‚Äôt last very long, but I added 18kW in fifteen minutes, so an average of 72kW.

The 208 is a much better motorway cruiser than Zoe. You can easily keep up with traffic, and the steering doesn‚Äôt feel too vague. The car feels stable at motorway speeds, without the signature Zoe body roll. And last but not least, I find the seats very comfortable with no aches or pains at the end of the day!

when I tried it this afternoon I couldn‚Äôt get it to start. The charge port was flashing green and the dash was pulsing but the charge point kept reverting to ‚Äúinsert payment‚Äù then ‚Äúplug in car‚Äù and the lady on the phone reset the charger and it still wouldn‚Äôt work


however the AC fast charger worked fine but was soooooo slow

the missus was crying haha

With you on that - I think the only way of assuring delivery of any EV now is to sign up for a pre-order and pay the deposit. Number of units available at launch always seems relatively small. If the boat's missed at the pre-order stage there's a very long wait for the next batch. 
There's no commitment so then one just keeps on looking to see if something else is launched that better fits requirements. Then cancel the pre-orders for the ones you don't want. Works best of all with an interest free credit card!

Click to expand...

I haven't seen any prices yet, but they are supposed to be 'keen' (whatever that means). I am planning to write a post on the pricing topic, but in short, I think that we have to be careful not to overpay for legacy manufacturers cars that are kept artificially high due to restricted demand. 

What ever way you look at it the prices for PCP on an eNiro or Kona are quite frankly ridiculous (c. ¬£5K deposit and c.¬£500/month for 36 months @ 10k miles). Yes, you may end up with some capital if the car is worth more than the GFV. 6 months ago I would be convinced that you would, but now I am not so sure and the buyer is taking the risk. There are so many electric cars being lined up for release over the next few years and I have not seen any convincing data that suggests huge demand at current prices at the moment outside of EV 'bubbles'/circles. The average consumer wants to pay the same as they are now for a 250 mile range and this doesn't exist. Add to this the confusion caused by Toyota and others with 'self-charging hybrids'.

Legacy manufactures will be restricting supply based on meeting new EU commission fleet targets, but there is a lot coming from China if you look at the Shanghai motor show. I know many people are not keen on buying a Chinese car, but in my lifetime, it was the same for Czech, Japanese and Korean cars and now people don't think twice about owning a Skoda, Toyota or Kia.",1,0

Yes, the yellow is a strange colour for the 'free' paint job. In my recent dealings with the automotive industry, I realise that there is not much money in making cars, most of the profit is in options, finance and after sales/parts. The cost difference in paint is negligible, so it is pure profit.

The other thing I would recommend is the TomTom live. In the iCockpit it is amazing, I think that my wife would chose a car on this feature alone. Once you have it, you will want it on every car. When my wife uses the Zoe or any other car, she complains about the nav quality; I have to keep reminding her that it is 'special'. Here is a video

We need a large car and I really wanted to ditch the diesel and ideally have two EVs. But, at the beginning of 2018, there wasn't much choice, so an efficient petrol was a compromise.

I never thought that I would own a Peugeot as my experiences with friends and family were not great. But, trying to be as objective as possible, the new 5008 is an incredible car. We have done 18K trouble free miles. No rattles, the tech is brilliant, particularly the iCockpit, no hard plastics and the console layout is minimalist and extremely attractive. Our previous cars have included BMW, Mercedes, SAAB and I can honestly say the 5008 compares well with them (not on a power basis obviously).

So, I am enthusiastic about the Peugeot e-208, particularly as they are following a lot of the same design principles. I only hope that they don't over-price it.

Yes, it bounces you back into the lane and gets cross with you if you keep drifting (tested it and it tells you to keep your hands on the steering wheel). It does the job well as a safety feature and is useful for long journeys in the dark, but it is not any level of self driving. You can simply switch it off if you don't like it.

I am really surprised that this is included in the spec, but blind spot monitoring is an optional extra. I think that lane assist is expensive and blind spot monitoring is cheap. I expect that it has something to do with NCAP testing points.",2,2592704

I hope that it is priced at the lower end. It looks like it will go head to head with the Zoe II, which we don't know much about at the moment, but should be out before the end of the year. Renault can also produce in pretty high volumes now and I will expect there are a queue of existing Zoe drivers waiting for a range update.

As we have the new 5008, I can only agree with you, it is a better car than I could ever imagine Peugeot making. They are going through a transition phase at the moment and to say we are considering having two Peugeots in the family, this is something that I would have never believed.

I went to the local Robin and Day to ask about the e 208 and was given the run around, first no info and then it was end of the year for the ICE version and the e 208 was at least two years away, my comment was nonsense.

I actually looked at and still like the 308GTi but at ¬£400 a month for a car which will do 25K over four years it was to much money but if the e 208 is to expensive then may look at that again.

returned home and checked the PUG site and placed the deposit on the e 208 even though the option to do this was not there a few days ago - it is refundable so no issues.

PUG customer service have said - call from dealer during summer to spec out the car with delivery in Jan 2020 - why cant the dealer network get the same info.

I think PSA have the following idea:

Vauxhall / Opel - standard car
Citroen - stylish
Peugeot - Sporty
DS - Premium

The e-concept if ever launched is top of my list to purchase - that is one hell of a looker and forget the electric power (will get crazy pricing level), stick a 1.6 lump out of the 308GTi in there and it will sell like hot cakes.",0,None

I will expect there are a queue of existing Zoe drivers waiting for a range update.

Click to expand...

Most Zoe are bought as 2nd cars, this is evident by most buyers going for the slower charging R model, so I can't see many people rushing to trade in early for a few miles more range.

Clearly Zoe owners might decide to upgrade at end of PCP, but with low balloon in recent times, I expect many will keep them longer than 3 years.

With only an estimated 1400 e208 available next year it is unlikely Peugeot will offer any discounts, so it will be interesting to see if Renault continue to offer ""finance contributions"" when Zoe is updated later this year.

If people are happy driving a manual, fossil fuel car, then I am confident it will be cheaper on cost (PCP+fuel) basis to buy the petrol vs. electric 208. With most sales expected to be petrol, it wouldn't make sense for the electric one to be cheaper.

IMO the target market (for e208) is still going to be early adopters, people keen to reduce local pollution, Congestion Charge dodgers and perhaps some small business owners (due to low BIK). With limited rear space and a small (I agreed not to call it tiny) boot, I can't see it being a popular company car choice - AFAIK the Zoe wasn't.",2,2593756

I do completely agree with you, but there has been aggressive 'support' for the i-Pace and E-Tron on lease, but I suppose this is where their customer base is getting them. At one point I could have got an E-Tron on a complete like for like basis (pcp/lease, same miles and deposit) at a very similar price as a E-Niro. When the silly i-Pace prices were out, I had a quote for 10K miles p.a. amortised at ¬£500/month (includes deposit).

Its great reading quotes from the head of PSA, complaining about the new Co2 targets and blaming everyone apart from the motor industry.

Regarding pricing speculation based on the French pre-order site which offers 4 year lease at 299/month with 2400 down, it's interesting to note that the Italian pre-order site offers the same terms but at 349/month with a whopping 5900 down making the total cost over 4 years almost 23k compared to under 17k in France which is a considerable difference.

Name: Unnamed: 0, dtype: int64",29705,"May 3, 2019","LHDs built specifically for the EU market are worth considerably more than RHD cars even in the UK and hold their values better.
This is because ultimately they can be resold anywhere in the EU, whereas interest in a RHD is limited to the UK market for the obvious reason.

Converting to RHD would likely invalidate the warranty and would cause buyers later down the line to view the car with suspicion as the quality of the conversion would always be in question.

Driving an LHD in the UK is in some cases better than RHD. Parking is easier as you get out on the pavement not the road, and you can tuck the car further into the left on country lanes. As for overtaking, well, if you can‚Äôt see the oncoming road clearly, you‚Äôre too close to the vehicle in front of you to overtake anyway.

Keep it LHD and you‚Äôll sell it at a premium over a RHD later on to someone who‚Äôll likely take the car out of the country again.

Whilst we‚Äôre still in the EU, the EU Certificate of Conformity, issued by the manufacturer at point of production, can be used to easily re-register in the UK a car bought from another EU member state. You send it and the appropriate forms to DVLA with some money and they send you a V5 and registration number.

Post Brexit it‚Äôs possible that cars originally sold new in the EU will be treated like any other non EU import (US/UAE etc) and would have to go through an Individual Vehicle Approval Test at a DVSA test centre.
It‚Äôs a total ache in the behind usually involving changing headlights and speedometers, although of course the flat beam LED lamps and digital speedos in most EVs could negate that issue.

Had a second call from the bods marketing 208 yesterday. They fully expect pricing during June. Ordering should commence in September.

They've also confirmed an electric version will be available for test drive prior to ordering.

I expect they'll make available to dealers a small number of 208s and share them around on specific dates.",1,2622918

That is my point on what I pay for my GTi - total cost is around ¬£425 for lease and fuel - the e 208 needs to be less than this to make it worth while.

I will pay max ¬£360 for the car which allows ¬£60 per month for electric although would have thought it will cost less. I want the options I listed above included or to have a GT in place of the GT line as this will probably have the options I want from the start.

I want an ev but my 3008 ICE in 1.2 is pretty fuel efficient so the 208 ICE should be pretty good as well, they keep saying the car is more cost effective over 4 years than the ICE equivalent then lets see when we get called in the dealers.",0,2623906

Because it encourages people to take PSA finance rather than personal loan. Initially with Leaf & Zoe you got a much bigger PCP contribution vs. cash discount. Remember, PCP is all about trying to sell you a new car after 3 years and if you get (say) a 5 year personal loan that isn't so likely.

It is also easier to stop or reduce the contribution compared to changing price lists, etc.",2,2623862

As previous answer said, PCP is a great way to get someone on a cycle of buying half a car and rolling over to a new deal every three years. Also, they choose the interest rate (4.9% seems typical, I can borrow from my bank at 2.8), and can force dealer servicing, and maybe get a bonus if you go over the mileage threshold.",1,2623862

If I had a few mins I would do a Venn Diagram of pre-orders. But simply speaking, how many enthusiasts have hedged their bets and have 2-4 pre-orders, but only want one car? I am currently at 3 pre-orders and whilst I would like two EVs, I will only take one of this batch, because of size/range. I have stopped adding any other pre-orders as @Tim Ostler says, I have Pre-Order Fatigue and I don't know where it will end. I notice that the new DS has pre-order, same for Honda and before the end of the year you can add Mini and Corsa to this list. Lets hope Renault doesn't do the same.",4,0

I completely agree however they're a business and they will have seen the Kona and Niro sell out quickly. Therefore they could just put ¬£5k onto the ""ICE plus battery"" price so it still sells, but they bank an extra ¬£5k for each order.

I don't see how Chinese BEVs will help PSA reduce their emissions? Also, except for MG I don't see any other models in near term?

Comparing a like for like car. Electric vs Petrol your most probably saving in the region of 10p a mile. So to save ¬£200 a month you must be doing around 25k miles a year which is double the average.

You seem to be assuming that the entire premium paid for an EV is completely lost as soon as you drive it off the forecourt. If the electric and ICE versions depreciate at the same rate, you would not have quite as much to spend on petrol. Ignoring any cost for financing the extra ¬£10k, let‚Äôs assume the ¬£15k ICE vehicle and the ¬£25k EV both lose 50% of their value after 3years. They are now worth ¬£7.5k and ¬£12.5k respectively. The premium is now only ¬£5k. 3 years of saving 10p a mile at 12000 miles per annum is ¬£3.6K. The premium is now only ¬£1.4k or ¬£467 per annum. Cheaper servicing, road tax, parking in some cities, congestion charge and ULEZ in the case of London could reduce that figure even more. So for less than an additional ¬£10 per week, you get to drive a lovely electric car and are doing your bit for the environment. That‚Äôs why my Zoe Is only 29p per mile total cost.",0,0

We do 8k miles per annum in the small car and as such use around ¬£120 of fuel each month and servicing is an average of ¬£35 per month - the car is ¬£300 per month with insurance at ¬£30 per month so a total cost for a 208GTi is ¬£485 per month.

I am assuming the new 208 with a 1.2 pure-tech will use a little less fuel per month over the same mileage, say ¬£100 plus a little cheaper on servicing / RFL / Insurance so maybe ¬£445 per month in total.

If the e 208 is ¬£400 per month and electric is ¬£15 / servicing is ¬£20 / insurance ¬£20 then there is a ¬£10 cost penalty - the PCP needs to be ¬£350 to be financially sensible to me.

The big thing is that I have to pay the PCP of ¬£400 each month even if the car does not move whereas with the ICE option if it does not move it only cost me the ¬£300.

I do not think the e 208 will drop to the same residual value as the ICE equivalent over 3 or 4 years but Dean is correct that premium over an ICE cars is to great - 25 to 30% is acceptable or in the PCP cost which is the important thing

They have about 1400 cars in UK for 2020 to sell retail. Not to fleets, so they need to find sales with private buyers or small businesses.

I can't see many small business directors getting a 208, so most need to go to private buyers. Hence they need price to be sensible.

Maybe, but if they wanted an ""company"" EV for a 2nd car (due to 2% BIK) an older Zoe, Leaf, Soul, etc would suffice and is far cheaper than a new car.

I just can't see many business owners buying a small 200 mile range EV as their main car. The 208 isn't family sized with a small boot and (having to accommodate ICE option) not much room in back. Small business buyers may be tempted by 2% BIK, but many still need a car that can cope with family trips and don't want hassle/delays of stopping to charge.

If I was still going to clients all over UK I would not have a 200 mile BEV - that is why I drove an Ampera for over 4 years. Now I work more locally the Zoe is OK, but we will soon have the Model 3 LR-AWD as our main car - or if I do need to travel further for work.",0,2634496

Infuriating isn't it? Peugeot, an original member of the parent group, can't give any price information for their own car in the UK. Meanwhile indicative prices have been available on the Peugeot France site since pre-ordering began. 

....and the latest firm to join the group, Vauxhall, manages to display full pricing details and PCP quotes on their website for the e-Corsa. A car that shares the e-208 platform and running gear and won't be delivered for nearly a year. 

Information about order and delivery dates given by the firm calling reservation holders seems to vary between members of this board. There's literally nothing coming from the Press Office. As you'd expect that department to have any information that existed, asking a dealer anything is literally a waste of breath.",0,2647538

One wonders where they'll go now Vauxhall have stuck a price on the screen of the e-Corsa.

Anyway few phone calls back and forth and I‚Äôve just had a call from Peugeot to confirm that my order is safe and sound and it was an error at head office.

Have to say I was a bit surprised as I was expecting deliveries next summer. The website says we can test drive before ordering so that suggests the demo cars are going to be at dealers in the UK in the next 3 months or so.

It almost looks recently as if manufacturers have been looking at the cost benefits to the buyer of running an EV, those being the PICG and difference between electricity and petrol/diesel, then adding them to the price of the car, thereby zeroing out the benefit.

The exact wording was:

Thank you for contacting PEUGEOT.

The full price and specification guide is looking to be released in September/October 2019 to link in with the preliminary orders, with the test drives taking place at your local PEUGEOT dealership in January 2020

Click to expand...

When I placed the deposit the bloke who called a few days later was emphatic - They have no clear idea of when the price information will be released but they were hoping imminently and certainly by the end of June with test drives PRIOR to ordering in September.

Now they‚Äôve not go more definite information that they‚Äôve chosen not to share with people who‚Äôve reserved a car. You only know because you emailed them.

Worse still that information is totally contrary to the order of things laid out when the reservation was made.

Meanwhile Vauxhall have prices out with PCP figures and the rest of Europe has prices for the Peugeot.

With their customer service so lacking and the flow of information so shambolic at this early stage, I definitely don‚Äôt want the full ownership experience thanks.

Cancelling tomorrow and will gladly tell them why. Don‚Äôt expect them to give so much as a Gallic shrug though.",0,2665324

If you‚Äôve got the ¬£24.5k to stuff into a depreciating asset for a couple of years, you‚Äôre probably not in the market for a Corsa.
If you‚Äôre refinancing it once bought from Vauxhall. I doubt you‚Äôll get 5.2% from a third party PCP funder.

Personally I wouldn‚Äôt want to plan to actually own either the Corsa or e-208 at the mo. Remains to be seen what will happen to used values of electric superminis whose prices are exponentially higher than those of their ICE brethren. Might work in the buyer‚Äôs favour, but with only the Zoe in that sector it‚Äôs quite risky.",0,2665610

That's where we're at. Lost patience with all this nonsense of paying for reservations for cars that either don't materialise with reasonable time of proposed date, or/and end up being more than I believe they're worth when put up against their ICE equivalent. It remains to be seen how hard their 2, 3 and 4 year residual values will actually be in practice as the market is changing so quickly.

So I'm selling the current almost 3 years old i3 Rex to replace it with a 9 month old i3 Rex. That gives Mrs F something almost new to run about in that's already lost a decent lump of its initial value and has a couple of years of warranty left. 
We'll change to a brand new EV at some point over the next 12 to 18 months when something jumps out at us that she really likes. By that time a few of these proposed cars should have actually been delivered.",0,2666236

They're definitely using a 3rd party marketing firm. Can't remember the name of it. But the communications problems are endemic in Peugeot UK itself. Their Press Office have not one clue what's going on with e-208 launch either. They messed me around for weeks telling me one thing one day and the opposite another.

Raises more questions than it answers really. Regen really doesn‚Äôt sound useful at all. 
I guess that leaves Peugeot still able to make money out of discs and pads.

The ‚Äúrocking and rolling‚Äù suspension isn‚Äôt good either. Pitching around does little to help range. Certainly a basic spec car from the snaps, but there‚Äôs no guidance I‚Äôve found that confirms that suspension in the GT will be any different.

To go for test drive on Saturday. But its just short drive. 
Standard range does not come with LED headlights .

Also seen the new corsa today it's night and day inside . The 208 such a nicer car inside. 

Not sure about all the black shinny plastic. 

Asked about longer test drive does not seem be thing they are open to . I want test drive a car at lease 24 hours or longer to see what trully it was give full charge .

Hello I am probably in the wrong place but I need HELP!
My Pergot Ion is sitting in my garage with a flat battery! I have tried connecting it to my charger where it has happily charged with no problem for a few years!
Today nothing it just clicks off and the orange car symbol is flashing!
I lifted the bonnet and connected the ancillary 12v battery to a charger. I may have left the lights on or something stupid.
Any ideas if I have done the right thing and how soon will I be able to try my mains charger?

Post this in the PSA Peugeot Citro√´n EV Forum further down where the Ion folks are. Someone will know. But on all EV's it seems the 12v Battery, used to ""boot"" the computers and start up the cars or parts of it gives problems so its worth charging it up. give it a few hours if you really think it has been flattened by leaving lights on or similar

I had a test drive in a Peugeot ion 2011 registration yesterday and was very disappointed with the lag and speed below 20 miles per hour.
Above 20 miles per hour the car was fine in fact it was great!
But on two busy roundabouts it was dangerously slow to get away from a standing start.

Click to expand...

Yep, that's just how they are I'm afraid. I've driven two different Ion's and they were both the same - really slow to get rolling up to about 10-15 mph then very nippy from 20-40mph, embarrassing many much larger ICE cars in this speed range, and pretty good up to 50mph in fact before the performance goes flat.

There is artificial torque limiting programmed in below about 10mph that severely limits the initial takeoff torque, presumably to avoid wheelspin in a light RWD car.

Not so bad on the flat but if you are trying to get moving from a standstill uphill especially with a load this can add seconds to the time it takes to reach 20mph because that initial low speed torque is only just enough to get moving up an incline.

It's a crying shame as the motor has 185Nm that it should be able to produce from zero RPM if it wasn't so artificially restricted like this. Theoretically reprogramming the ECU could remove this limit but I haven't heard of anyone doing this.



I see that the 0-60 time is given as 15 seconds and yet there is a YouTube video of one doing it in only 12secs how is this possible?

Click to expand...

0-60 is quoted as 15.9 seconds, but this must be absolute worst case scenario like a low SoC at below freezing winter conditions etc. Acceleration is noticeably less in below freezing conditions I find.

I've timed mine using Dynolicious and I get about 12 seconds sometimes slightly less. They are a lot quicker than they look on paper, except for that sluggish start up to about 10-15 mph. I've just learnt to live with it and anticipate my throttle stab when trying to merge onto busy roundabouts but it can be a bit nerve wracking when you get it wrong and there is nothing you can do to get out of the way any quicker once you've committed!

I also avoid smaller openings that I would have happily taken on my Auto ICE which has very quick ""get you out of trouble"" initial acceleration.",0,None

Can't say I've tried that, however I will say that if you press the brake pedal and accelerator down together (at least while already driving) it will cut the maximum power available by about half, as clearly shown by the power meter.

Why do I know this ? From trying to bed in the brakes after replacing discs/pads, and wanting to give the brakes good hard but brief applications.

One thing that does seem to make it slightly faster off the mark is to disable traction control - not recommended in anything other than warm/dry conditions of course, because in the wet/snow/ice you could swap ends without the traction control enabled if you drive like an idiot...

0-60 time doesn't really change, but that first 0-10mph does seem slightly quicker with traction control off.

It might be my imagination, but it does also seem slightly quicker to get moving if you only press the throttle to say 25% until after you're moving rather than just stamping it straight to the floor - but the result of this seems inconsistent to me.

Easing off the brake enough so that ""creep"" is enabled may also help slightly as when you press the foot brake hard while stopped creep is disabled and there is definitely a fraction of a second delay before power is enabled again when you release the brake. So a couple of seconds before you're ready to move off, ease off the brake until you feel it tug forward slightly and you can avoid this extra delay when moving to the accelerator.",0,2367056

My ICE is a 3 litre petrol V6 Auto so I do notice the lack of oomph in the 0-15mph range in the Ion unfortunately. I can be half way out into the roundabout in that in the time that it would take the Ion to start rolling at all. ",1,2367148

I must give that a try, even if only at roundabout entrances...

Click to expand...

Yes there is definitely filtering/rate limiting on the throttle pedal, it's not just one factor.

As I mentioned when you press the brake pedal moderately hard, creep is turned off to save power, and there is a significant delay of about half a second that you can feel from the time you release the pedal until forward drive is re-engaged.

This is particularly noticeable when starting on an uphill where the car will actually roll back quite a bit before the creep arrests the movement.

So if you go quickly from brake to throttle there is at least half a second lost before any power is applied to the motor at all. If you ease the brake pedal off just enough until it tugs forward but not enough to fully release the brake, that delay is removed, and in fact I use this method when I'm starting on a hill to avoid rolling back too much towards the car behind me...

Your method of pressing brake and accelerator together would also eliminate this delay.

Another delay is that the car seems to transition the torque very slowly across the backlash boundary. What I mean by that is that there is a significant delay to the throttle response when you transition from acceleration to regen or vica versa. This is probably done to minimise the stresses on the gearbox and driveshaft joints (the joints are tiny!) when the backlash on the gears and joints moves from positive to negative and also for reasons of a smoother driving experience.

This is particularly noticeable for example if you are doing 30mph under slight regen then floor it, there is quite a big delay before acceleration really kicks in, and it sort of ramps up, while if you were doing that same 30mph with a modest amount of positive power then you floor it, throttle response is much more instant with less of a ramp because you're not crossing that backlash boundary.

It seems likely that starting from zero torque at zero speed has this same ramping up characteristic that you see when crossing from regen to acceleration.

There also seems to be some low pass filtering of the accelerator to take the sharp edge off its response - turning off traction control does seem to reduce the low pass filtering of the accelerator pedal movement somewhat, especially to small movements and can make it feel a bit more responsive even though foot to the floor acceleration times aren't really changed. It also seems to transition the backlash boundary between regen and acceleration quite a bit quicker with traction control off.

Some of the ramping up of torque when accelerating from a standstill seems to be related to road speed (hence why it's so hard to get moving up a steep incline, because you have to actually gain speed before you get more torque, but you have so little torque to begin with at 0mph - barely enough to climb against gravity on the incline) and some of it seems to be a time/throttle filtering reaction as you go past the zero torque point.

A little bit of reprogramming of the EV_ECU could transform the performance of these during launching. I wonder if any of the ECU chipping companies will ever offer reprogramming of them for better performance or is that just wishful thinking given the relatively small number of these cars on the road ?

On the other hand there is an after market CAN-bus cruise control available for them...",1,2367184

It's possible to easily beat the official 0-60mph time in a Leaf as well.
If anyone simply floors the throttle, there are 'things' (I don't know what you'd call them) put in place that limit power at 12mph and 24 mph.
With time, you learn you get far better acceleration not flooring the throttle, you learn the sweet spot.

I wonder if the reaction to flooring the pedal from stationary is a preemptive over reaction from the traction control system ?

The on-screen prompts and online instructions about map data / software updates says to ensure that the 'engine' is running while the software updates. For the ev, it just means switched on and ready to move, so the DC-DC converter is on to keep the 12V battery topped up. For petrol engine, you'd not want to be doing that in a garage.

This does not mean that the 12 V battery is dead.

I'll just add that I, too, get this when I turn on the system without pressing the brake pedal. The symbol comes on soon after.

Until someone finds an official reference to what that symbol actually means, I'm going to say the best guess is that it's just warning you of the 12 V being used without it receiving energy to compensate for it (looks like without the READY mode being on, the high-voltage battery won't be used to charge the 12 V one). Doing that for too long could lead to it depleting too much, enough to damage it.",0,3212908

But if the parking brake still worked and the dash display and driving lights were still on (remember, I had not turned off the car but was still in ready mode when parked up).

So basically it seemed to go in to an odd standby mode when you were sitting there in ""ready"" mode. Even the radio was off. Only the USB was plugged in doing the sat nav update.

No they're not binding, (is that an issue with these ?) and they're working very well as far as actual braking goes - nice and progressive with plenty of bite.

It's the caliper that is rattling though - it almost seems as if the caliper slide pins are worn, or there is a missing anti rattle shim or the anti rattle shims have lost their springiness. I've had rattly calipers before but not to this extent.

It's due for its 6 year service in a couple of weeks, I wonder if they'll pick up on it...(they only would if they took it for a test drive!)",1,987161

Name: Unnamed: 0, dtype: int64",15953,"Dec 13, 2018","Just wanted to report that I have finally fixed the incessant rattly front brake calipers on my Ion over rough or broken seal that has been driving me batty for so long now. 

At the same time, I've also fixed an intermittent issue that was causing the front brakes to stick on slightly, causing vibration at motorway speeds, presumably due to the pad not being able to retract freely from the slight but normal amount of run-out in the disc. Instead it was being held lightly against the disc against the run-out, hence a slight vibration.

The same issue was also causing the brakes to intermittently be lacking in sensitivity, where you'd sometimes have to push the pedal worryingly hard to get anywhere near an emergency stop, and the brakes just seemed lacking in omph. All three problems turned out to have the same cause and cure.

As reported in another thread the caliper guide pins for the front brakes on these are very problematic in design. Specifically the lower guide pin has a machined down shank with a rubber bush on it, which can be seen in the following picture on the far right. The upper pin is metal only and can be seen in the middle:










Way back around January I discovered that this rubber bush was swollen to the extent that it was jamming free movement of the pin and was also trying to ride up onto the shank of the pin causing it to completely jam in the hole in the yoke. Not good! I found there was traces of mineral grease that someone had applied so I realised this could explain the swollen rubber. So at the time I ordered the seals kit for the front brakes - carefully cleaned out all traces of grease from the yoke holes and pin, fitted the new rubber bush and applied the correct silicone based grease that is compatible with the seals.

Some nine months later I was getting a hand from a mate to change the suspension drop-links and wanted to check the pins again and found that the bottom one on the right hand side was completely and utterly jammed solid. No way could I pull it out.  After probably 15 minutes of twisting it around and around with some mole grips I finally got it to let go and just like last time the rubber bush was completely swollen up to the point where it was riding up onto the shank of the bolt and jamming between the pin and the hole.  The left hand side bottom pin wasn't quite as bad but it too was severely jammed. This was a new rubber bush fitted 9 months earlier with the correct grease.

What's even more crazy is that the tip end of the pin has a square shank on the machined section but the other end has a taper which would tend to promote the bush to ride up out of it's position. Who designed that ?? In fact who thought to put a rubber bush there at all. 

Despite owning and repairing countless cars of my own over the years I've never owned or seen one with a rubber bush on a caliper guide pin like this before. I asked around a few car friends (mainly into French cars mind you) and none of them had seen this before either so it must be some Japanese thing. Not sure why it's even there - maybe as an anti-rattle bush, but if so it's a miserable failure as the caliper has been rattling like a b*****d ever since I've had the car.

Anyway, fed up with it constantly jamming, and the rattle of the caliper suggesting the pins were a bit worn I decided the best course of action was to conclude that Mitsubishi engineers made a boo-boo in the design of the bottom pin and replace all four pins with the metal only kind that are normally fitted only to the top. You can see one of the new pins on the left hand side of the image before I transferred the old rubber boot over to it. (They don't come with boots unless you buy a separate seals kit, and I had replaced the boots already back in January)

It turns out that the bolt attachment of both pins is identical and the diameter and depth of the yoke holes is also identical for top and bottom - in short, the pins designed for the top position fit perfectly in the bottom position. The parts guy was confused when I ordered four of the top pins instead of two of each but he took my word for it when I explained what I was doing! 

Although I felt it was likely that 4 new pins would solve the rattle (as well as the jamming) I had previously noticed that a ""noise reduction kit"" of shims was available for a tenner so decided to order that as well on the basis of ""belt and suspenders"" as I really wanted to nail that rattle. If a noise reduction kit is listed in the OEM parts list it suggests that rattling or squealing is a known problem on these! They look like this:










And they just slip easily over the pads:



















I don't know how much the pins contributed and whether the noise reduction shims made a difference but the front calipers are now blissfully, wonderfully silent for the first time in the 18 months I've had the car... 

On all but the very worst pothole or recessed manhole cover the front suspension/brake calipers are now completely silent, and it has the effect of making the car seem a lot more ""solid"" and well put together when it's not rattling over every bump and rough surface like an old bucket of bolts.  I've waited a few weeks to make sure the rattle didn't come back before posting about the work I've done.

Furthermore the front brakes are now working so much better. The slight vibration at the front at motorway speeds that I could feel on the steering is gone now (I assume that was brake drag on the run-out of the disc) and the brakes seem MUCH more sensitive both to light braking and hard emergency stops than ever before. I was actually beginning to think there was a serious problem with the brakes before as I was having to push the pedal very hard for a rapid stop. Not anymore.

Best of all I know there is no chance that that stupid rubber bush can swell up and jam things up again - because it's not there anymore! 

So if your C-Zero/Ion front brakes seem to stick on/drag, seem insensitive or are intermittently insensitive, or you have annoying caliper rattle over rough surfaces (which goes away when braking - if not, it's something else) then I can highly recommend fitting 4 new metal only pins and for good measure fitting the noise reduction shims as well. (Can't do any harm...)

Four pins are about ¬£20 and about ¬£10 for the noise reduction shim kit. Here are the part numbers:










The noise prevention kit (14) is 16 062 253 80 (only one kit required) and the upper pins (7) are 4440 09. (four required) They don't come with rubber boots so if the old rubber boots are damaged you'll also need the caliper repair kit (15) 16 062 255 80. I don't recall how much that one is but it's not a lot. It's unlikely to be needed though.

Remember to use a silicone based grease that is designed specifically for brake caliper pins and most definitely not copper slip or any mineral oil base grease. You want a reasonable amount on there to avoid any rattle but no so much that it starts hydraulicing in the hole!",3,None

A follow up to this thread, (albeit the car is now long gone) I would say that in hindsight most of the rattle comes from worn calliper slide pins allowing the whole calliper assembly to rattle around..

So my recommendation would be to replace the four calliper slide pins first and don't worry about the brake pad anti-rattle shim kit unless there is still some rattle after replacing the pins. (Although if you want to fit the shim kit as well, I don't see any harm)

I definitely recommend replacing the bottom pins that have the rubber bush/sleeving with the same type as the top pins which are metal only without the rubber bush. In other words rather than ordering two of 444009 and two of 444010, just order four of 444009 (top pin) and fit them in all four locations. The parts order guy might look at you strangely and wonder if you are mistaken, but that's what I did and it helped immensely.

Not only did having two snug fitting pins get rid of the rattle, it cured the ongoing problems I had with intermittent ""binding"" of the front brakes, which was basically caused by the rubber bush on the bottom pin swelling and/or getting stuck out of position, (it tends to ride up over the shoulder on the end of the pin) causing the bottom pin to get seriously jammed. This could cause the brakes to both stick on a bit, and also make them a lot less sensitive as the bottom end of the calliper was jamming restricting movement when you applied the brakes. The top pins are a perfect fit in the bottom holes, don't worry about that.

Keep in mind that these kind of gear selector switches have one or more ""intermediate"" contact positions between each valid position so that the ECU knows that it is in an invalid slightly between gears position.

While it says D, it's likely that the in between contact is being triggered and that will set an error in the ECU.

It sounds like your bowden cable might be slightly out of adjustment. (or perhaps seizing slightly) I can't remember for sure whether the adjustment is at the gear lever end or the gearbox end, I think it might be at the gearbox end though ?

If you can disconnect the bowden cable easily at the gearbox end and manually move the gearbox linkage (make sure the handbrake is firmly on!) see if you can get it to go into D without error by turning the linkage manually to the correct position - you might need an assistant to watch the dashboard while you do this.

If you can, try making an adjustment to the bowden cable. Count the turns that you adjust it so you don't lose your original position. You might be pressed for time trying to fix this before tomorrow though....!",0,3318862

Excellent. 

Yes mine was night and day too. I tried the pad noise reduction kit (shims) first and it did help a bit but the main clonking/rattling over potholes was still there and still quite obnoxious. After I replaced the pins it was more or less silent, and getting rid of the rubber bush variant of the pin at the bottom solved the issue of the brakes intermittently sticking on slightly as well, and improved the action of the brakes.

Name: Unnamed: 0, dtype: int64",1439,"Oct 10, 2015","As far as I understand it all, so far:-- On the Expert/Tepee and Boxer/Monach they used 3 phase Zivan NG9 chargers (worth around 6kW actual charge rate to the battery). They are of a particular non-standard PWM driven charger that are custom made to work with the Axeon BMS.

Whether they also used NG9, or whether its the NG5 (3kW) or NG7 (also 3 phase) on the Partner I don't know, but apparently what happened then was that at some stage the three phase chargers were considered inconvenient and single phase chargers were then retrospectively fitted to some of the vehicles, but not all. What the make of the single phase chargers is I don't know, but I believe those Allied vehicles with them in are clear by the finned (air cooled) chargers tucked behind the front radiator. If they don't have that, they are 3 phase only.

How they actually wired up the additional single phase charger when they added them I am not sure, but presume they just made L1 capable for both single or three phases.

Zivan does appear to have made a single phase NG5 at some stage along with its 3 phase version in that power rating, but these don't seem to be available any more.

I've taken a punt on a e-Expert and unfortunately it was 3 phase only, for which I am now paying a small additional price. It's now with @Mike Schooling waiting for him to fit an NG3 single phase charger for me, duly ordered, but there is a bit of a lead time from Zivan. I'm told there is no NG5 single phase charger, which is somewhat frustrating because the NG3 can only deliver a real 1.8kW to the battery, and at 43kWh that's going to be quite a long charge time!

Still OK of the purposes the van will be put to, a 10 hour charge every night should be plenty, but perhaps we'll need to look at upgrading that again at a later stage if, presumably when, EV chargers drop in price and a higher power replacement can be obtained.

The battery charges at 20 A, so that's 20A x 288V DC, or ~6kW. The charger will actually draw around 14~16A three phase so you are on the edge of what a 16A plug can do (or maybe it can't do it as a continuous draw, not sure), so looks like they went with the 32A size for a big margin.",0,0

Name: Unnamed: 0, dtype: int64",4286,"Nov 27, 2015","I too have been intrigued by the recent flush of Allied conversion 5 seater Partners on the market.

On paper one of these would suit us down to the ground, we have always been a 2 car couple but involuntarily downgraded to 1 after some idiot emerged from a side street and smacked into the osf of my 15 year old BMW 530d estate and tucked the front wheel under the engine! This occurred just at the point when the insurance was due to renew and the wife was due for double total knee replacement so we didn't bother replacing it.

Like many people our motoring is quite polarised, on the one hand long trips and towing a caravan and on the other endless short tedious journeys within a 5 mile radius of home. All the work is now being done by our Mercedes E320 estate (which we bought principally for towing the caravan (and because I wanted one!)) and sitting in the traffic after my 5th 5 mile journey of the day at an average 22mpg I could not help but think how much better suited an EV would be. Particularly as we have economy 7 and so can charge at half price overnight, bonus!

I have been so far as to have a test drive, and I was quite impressed. With 5 on board (probably at near capacity which is a payload of only c500kg) it acquitted itself quite well climbing a 20% hill at 30 mph and not flat out. I am assured that it did a 60 mile round trip and left 30% in the tank so range wise it would seem to be OK. My only observations were that the steering seemed a little vague and it was sat a bit low at the back end with barely 4 inches ground clearance to the rear battery box, and that was before we all got in!

So far so enthusiastic, but then the support anxiety creeps in, if it fails to proceed one morning who do I call? Most of the failures these days on modern cars are to do with electronics, sensors and the like and diagnostics are dependant on being able to ""read the codes"". Anyone near Glasgow may stand a chance if Allied will talk to you but that is not feasible from here in Leeds!

Also why would you want to but one of a fleet that was subject to a legal case based on poor availability due to breakdowns. Were all the problems fixed or are they still unreliable?

So, maybe I should be sensible and by a 1.4 diesel version and play safe, is the saving on running costs of 5000 miles a year worth the risk? But, I am from Yorkshire and the appeal of summat for nowt is quite strong and I am quite techie and adventurous so maybe it will be interesting to have an EV.

So to the questions:
1. Did any of the EV curious ever pursue their interest and buy an Allied Partner and are they happy?
2. I note the reference to them being sensitive to mains spikes and so would buy a filter but is there any issues with the presence of a PV installation on site as we have 4kw on the roof (more free electric when the sun shines!) as I understand that they can be quite noisy?
3. What is the support situation like particularly in the frozen north? Grumpy-b made a reference to looking in to this?
4. Are they all low on the backend?
5. Do we have the basis of an Allied Partner Owners Club? I understand that there is a limited potential membership! I am told there were 20 in the recent batch liberated from Glasgow and I have watched 4 of these go through on ebay, but maybe they are all still in the hands of dealers?

All comments and or advice welcome!

Call @Mike Schooling at Indra.

He has been working on my Allied e-Expert (more about that later) and the guy's a genius. He appears to have fixed a 'non-starting' design fault in hours that Allied didn't figure out in 6 years.

I contacted him to ask for his support before buying it, and he was happy to help when/if needed.

He's already given far better service for me that I'd ever expect from 'a dealer', being friendly, communicative and interested in the engineering. 3 key things missing from many dealers!

They actually look like pretty simple pieces of kit and not 'hidden' behind a load of proprietary CAN functionality that only dealer computers can access, so in a way the long term prospects for maintenance might even be better than a mainstream 'new-gen EV'. At least, that is how I have persuaded myself about it! Stuff goes wrong, and I hope nothing does from now on, but I can't see any EV out of warranty having particularly cheap parts to fit if we're talking motors, inverters and the like. As the vehicle is already a modification of an existing one, I'm trusting that in the event of something dire then at least we'd have a choice of possible replacement parts, whereas with a mainstream EV you'd be pretty much locked into fitting only the manufacturer's parts.

I'll be writing up my e-Expert experiences a bit later, maybe that will be something to reflect on. I think if you are a worrier (which I am!) then go cautiously over one, but if you are ready for a challenge and see it as a bit of a hobby activity then there are plenty of other ways of wasting your money that have far fewer prospects of ever turning out to being useful! Given the low offer prices, it should only take a couple of years to see a genuine financial benefit after any 'initial set-up costs' to get the thing in full order.",2,205263

If anyone does require support with these then please let me know.

We have now built up quite a knowledge on them and already resolved some fairly major common issues.

If anyone gets an Allied Expert it is worth mentioning there is a very serious safety issue in the rear battery box where one of the high voltage cables gets 'pinched'. I would suggest that anyone that buys one gets it inspected. I have raised my concerns to allied but I can't see a recall happening!

I'll also mention that single phase is quite possibly a no go depending on which charger is fitted to the teepee. One model has no neutral so an adaptor wont work (at least safely).",3,None

The matching inverter has had problems and aparently are prone to damage in a number of ways, these were one of the issues that were had with Glasgow. Although there appears to have been suggestions that it was operator abuse. ie they did something in a way not intended and that gives a problem. Ansaldo do not respond to any email address published, neither do the parent company who own them. They no longer publish any information on the EV parts.
Fortunately the Inverter is actually very basic device built up internally from a series of quite large circuit boards, so board level repairs are possible, however the Spike issue wipes some part of its memory requiring not only potentially component repairs but a re load of data. I believe Allied can do that.
Allied do still have some spares, and recently supplied a board for an inverter that I removed from a customers Partner. The three phase chargers do appear to have the single phase option, and the Italian makers will repair them (Another customer has just sent his for repair) The three phase/singlephase unit uses the connection between phases 1 and 2 for single phase, not using neutral as you would expect. These make of chargers are used in a number of conversions, but they are mostly sold as OEM kit so they do not sell singly having a large single order value, and only make them to order / requirements. 
The Battery pack was made by Axeon, who are now Johnson Matthey batteries, and used old versions of the BMS but basically the same as used in the Modec truck. Neither of which Axeon now support, or hold spares for, having cleared out all legacy parts and information when they became JMB. The cells are standard parts, and I do have a few ex Modec BMS parts in stock. Being Lifepo4 the cells are fairly good, and single cell replacements are possible and a whole pack is not required if a cell failure occurs.
As with any Conversion, co-operation by the builders would make life a lot easier, but also like most conversions there will have been a continual change in the way the conversions were carried out and some of the components will have changed.
I know of two chargers that have died because of spikes on the mains in rural areas where supply is poor, as well as one inverter being damaged during charge by spikes. This sounds odd, but according to Allied service chap is a common problem, The inverter being on the main power circuit during charge and the charger gives out a short high voltage DC spike following the AC spike, and that damages the Inverter. 
Allied still have about 18 vehicles , not part of the Glasgow deal, and will continue to support them as long as they are in warranty, beyond that is unknown, but they already have few people who know the vehicles left / working on the EV side. But they are unwilling to relinquish support / have competition while those vehicles are still viable/ being supported by them. But not unwilling to consider a different approach long term, both Mike Schooler and I appear to have approached Allied on this front.",2,None

Hi Mike,

I don't know how many long trips you do but wouldn't hiring a suitable vehicle when needed make much more financial sense? 

One other issue on the 'should I/shouldn't I' question is to bear in mind is how the van is heated. If it relies on the battery pack and you do much sitting around in traffic then that is, in my view, a -ve. If it has a fuel (eek!)-based heater, like a Webasto, then that is a significant +ve. If it has a LEAF-like heat pump system then its a neutral/+ve.

I would be interested to hear more on the technical side of the conversion ie what inverter etc is used. It is quite possible that a substitute inverter could be found should the supplied one fail and not be repairable - likewise the charger and BMS. Unlike a modern ICEV, conversions are usually pretty modular.

I can offer the attached 'EDN Group' 'CMP253-02 Charger Users Manual' for everyone's delectation and in the interests of getting these seemingly capable EVs happy new homes...

Good luck. MW",0,None

I replaced the 3-ph Zivan NG9 in the e-Expert with a single phase NG3 (3kW). I did not want to test out wiring it up in other ways for fear of wrecking the NG9 and having a total brick because I did ask around and I was advised by both Allied and Zapi that the NG9 could not be charged single phase, Allied saying that some vehicles were fitted with both, signified by a finned heat sink of the single phase charger visible behind the radiator. I believe most of the Partners came with both 3 and single phase chargers, but the e-Experts didn't.

Zapi-fit advised on the equivalent NG3 and supplied, @Mike Schooling fitted it for me and did a grand job making it a J1772 plug-in system.

Zapi said that Zivan no longer did the single phase NG5's (5kW) due to lack of purchases, which is unfortunate because the NG3 is a mere 7A output (~2kW) and means the 140Ah 40kWh battery of the e-Expert takes 20 hours for a full charge. This is no problem for us as the van will be mostly used less than 50 miles a day, and less than 100 miles in a week typically, so there is actually plenty of charging 'time' available at off peak rates to keep up with that mileage.

One worry I have always had with EVs long term is battery degradation as this is really an unknown, so this was quite a punt from my POV. However, the 84 x 160Ah Winston (Thundersky) LiFYPO batteries still appear fully 100% fit after 5 years and 13k miles. Zero degradation. I have no worries at all about the battery packs now. With 70% cycling, Winston claim 7000 charge cycles for these cells (= 500,000 miles, which is 100 years of use at our intended mileage for it!).

However, e-Partners used a different cell type and so I can't say anything about those.",0,205289

It is good to know that there is trusted expertise out there albeit at some distance in Worcestershire and Essex.

To comment on the points raised.

My understanding is that the EPNR comes with both single phase and 3 phase charge leads although the latter is clearly not relevant for a domestic base where overnight charging should suffice. One of the dealers told me that he had made contact with someone who was able to create a lead which would enable charging from a public charge point and he was awaiting delivery, this would be a useful backstop for slightly longer trips although I have not had chance to get my brain round the various standards for public charge points.

HD springs or spring assisters would be the solution to the droopy back end syndrome and thanks for confirming that it is not just the one I was looking at that is effected, in fact I am told that the ICE versions are similarly afflicted. I am guessing that these vehicles are very easy to overload, all you need is 5 chunky occupants at more than 100kg each, add a couple of suitcases and there you are, overloaded!

The ""EV as only car and hire when needed for long trips"" is a perfectly valid one but, we have an ""elephant in the room"" in the shape of a twin axle 1800kg caravan that needs dragging about plus a 600kg trailer for various building projects; the Merc is a 7 seater for the 4 going on 5 grandchildren (we used to have a Seat Alhambra but the Merc is better on a number of levels!); also quite often the wife and I are on separate missions which means that 2 cars are in use simultaneously (or will be after she has recovered from her second knee replacement in January).

Thanks in particular for the heads up on the high voltage cable pinching issue (this sounds definitely to be a potential serious issue. It would be good to get this checked pre purchase, is it reasonably easy to do a DIY visual check? 

The heating system is diesel powered and it appears to be very effective. Not many people realise that many larger diesel powered cars have diesel powered coolant heaters, the BMW, Merc and Alambra all had them. They make themselves apparent when they fail. I once came back from Luton in sub zero temperature and there was a 20 mile stretch of road works at 50mph during which the engine temperature fell to about 40 and the heater was most ineffective! The burner was fine but it cost me ¬£500 for a new control module!

As I said I am pretty much sold on the concept and given some confidence that I will not be alone in the enterprise, look seriously at getting one!

Quite so but most bar heaters are 1kW.

If you use Schuko plugs you need the check that:

a) they can take the load your device needs - should normally be okay since almost every Schuko plug you can buy is rated at 16A, not more, not less
b) the cable to the current breaker can take that load (2.5mm2 at a minimum; 4.0mm2 if the cable is longer than say 20m)

I shall throw in my few answers to your questions.

I have had my Partner Tepee for over two months now and have clocked up over 2,000 miles in that time averaging between 50 - 75 miles per work day. For the 75 mile journey I charge in work, so approx. 37 mile each way, this takes approx. 45% of the charge, however I live in very hilly terrain and my average speed is 30mph (uphills) - 50mph (open road). All great so far but I am well aware there will come a point where I have to push it into the garage and seek help, I hope some of the experts on here are open to an all expenses paid holiday to Northern Ireland!! I really liked Donald's line and consider it sums it up perfectly ""..but if you are ready for a challenge and see it as a bit of a hobby activity then there are plenty of other ways of wasting your money that have far fewer prospects of ever turning out to being useful!""

Following Jeremy's advice the first purchase I made was a good Surge Arrester from APC. This was a big worry for me as I have both a 2.5kW Proven Wind Turbine and 4kW of PV and I live in the middle of nowhere, so the epitome of Rural. I still use the standard three pin plug, its gets warm to the touch but not excessive. I will change to a 16A at home but will continue to use the 13amp plug through the window into the kitchen in work.

I got down on my hands and knees with a ruler this morning, mine measures 160mm from ground to bottom of the battery box. Even though it runs low I have been down plenty of roads with grass down the centre with no difficulty, the brochure says the suspension is upgraded.

The steering on mine is typical to a Peugeot, my brother has a 306 and they are very similar apart from the regenerative braking which takes a little getting used to.

In relation to the white box in the boot, I will leave this up to the experts however I have noted that not all of the ones for sale had it in the boot so I assume it was a later modification. I can open mine and see what's inside if it would help.

It is great to see a gathering of the owners of the Allied Electric vehicles on this forum and hopefully over the coming months we will all congregate here. An owners meet could prove difficult though, would take a few days for us all to get there!!

All the best with your decision.

I have seen dozens and dozens of Zivan NG3s and only a few with faults, even these can generally be repaired by the importers, but for me its often not worth spending cash on a used charger. They do however stipulate that they will not accept any warranty claim if the unit has been used on a generator, so be warned. If you ask for supply for such use they will refuse. Probably because the surge / spike sections get blown.
If you ever think about using a generator only ever use the sort of thing they use at Festivals, ie the size of an outside toilet laid on its side. Or a well oversized inverter generator. These use a simple DC generator and then create a pure sine wave (assuming its a decent bit of kit) with the inverter section.

If that's 2-3 litres for say 5 days, 500cc per day, that's really par for the course. You'd get around 3kWh equivalent of heat energy out of that, which I would guess is pretty much what you'd use for a resistive heater (about 10 to 15% range loss equivalent on a Leaf, say).",0,None

The main reason for this is simply that the eberspacher on my e-Expert isn't working! But I looked further into this and I could get it fixed, but do I really want to?

The details/specs etc say that they should be serviced once every 12 months/2000hrs. Whaaat? No way, thanks! This costs anywhere from ¬£85 (ship off to an ebay guy) or ¬£200 (one of the established places) and they'll de-coke it for you, etc etc, and that's taking off, shipping and re-fitting it yourself. If you don't then what can happen is the whole thing jams up (as mine has) and doesn't want to play any more, with big repair bills. If the burner tube gets coked then the fan doesn't run properly and burns out, or runs slower and causes more soot, etc etc.. You get the idea, it's dino technology with all the associated servicing and chimney cleaning issues.

I was very interested in hoping Renault might have some fuel-powered heater they could put in the Fluence, to extend its range (as they offer one for the Kangoo already) but sort of glad I wasn't persuaded (I was actually thinking of a catalyst driven gas heater arrangement). I now have the Ampera, which not only burns fuel for heat but generates 'waste electricity' too! 

The e-Expert has a 40kWh battery so the relative range drop (i.e. rather than actual energy drop) should be less on electric heating than on smaller BEVs.... I presume.

I wish you well with your heater, and I think it is a good idea in a BEV with, as we know, a heavily drawn on battery in the winter months. But electric heating has to be better in the long run, I think? Just the idea of having to top it up with oily liquids seems like going backwards (but I say that with all due caveats and caution at a time when the e-Expert isn't actually working! ).",0,None

Thanks to James for telling his story, your comments were very helpful in making the decision. And everyone else of course!

Thanks also for the pictures and information as to what is in ""the box in the boot"". It seems crazy to me to impinge on the load space like this! I assume that Allied would not have done this lightly or perhaps they were just being lazy? I wonder if there is any chance or relocating the thing. Hearing that it is a DC to DC converter for the HV to run the 12v ancillaries is interesting I was wondering if the 12v battery was enough to run things for the duration of the range on the traction batteries and this explains things, it doesn't have to!

On the point of the 12v battery it has been explained to me that there is a constant drain on the 12v because it and the traction systems ""talk to each other"" whilst the car is turned off, so it is best to disconnect it if you are leaving the car unused or not on charge for a couple of weeks. Does this ring true with anyone. I assume that if the car is not in use you are as well leaving it on charge and it will manage things?

The discussion on Cab heaters was useful also. All of our recent cars have had heated seats pretty much at my wife's insistence so I can see the Eberspacher being well used. For service and parts I was going to suggest commercial vehicle service places, there was one in Leeds called Sewells who helped me out with a Webasto some years ago. sadly a quick internet search indicates that they went bust!

Yes the 12v systems do seem to have quite a high parasitic load - disconnecting the battery is advised.

On the heater remote turn on. Should be doable. Look at some of the car alarm kits with remote start. Putting that through a 10 minute latching relay or similar would probably work quite nicely. Only issue is that the blower wont be on so nothing to move the heat around. May also want to tap the feed from the blower relay in the fusebox to turn that on too.

DCDC can be relocated. It is inside the cab to protect against water ingress - it is not suitably IP rated and does require airflow so cant be put in an enclosure. We swapped one out last week for a ford/tdk unit which went underneath. Completely sealed and silent

Oh, they are both important. When it's -20 or less you don't want to get into a frozen car. At very low temperatures inside components like wiper stalks and such can break or power window motors seize and similar such nuisance, if the inside is not heated. Not to mention pure comfort. Mains powered heaters are more popular as cheaper And better for environment. 

Obviously this requires mains connections infrastructure so most work car parks and housing car parks have mains connections by every parking space.

In my view the Dc to DC with a decent size of battery is really important. You need 12v to get the vehicle to function. The radio etc will consume power, as will central locking etc and as such is a pain, I do a simple device that I put in some vehicles that turns on the DC to DC when the 12v reaches 12.2v for 20seconds, and then runs for two hours. Keeps the battery alive. 
As to the use of DC to DC. 
Heaterfan, 4+amps Sidelights and headlights, 12 to 15amps, power steering pump (hydraulic in these if I remember ) up to 70amps at full load. Vacuum pump 4amp, Radio as much as your ears can stand A. Wipers 4amps etc etc.
The point being the Battery would have to be really large to cope with the serious loads that can get put on it. When there is no need when you have a DC to DC to top it up and the battery to meet the peaks and troughs. In the same way I would not advocate just having a DC to DC and a tiny battery. You would need a seriously big DC to DC to cope with perhaps a 100+ amps at full load. Ie driving in the dark, cold, raining , and parking or going around a corner. (with or without the radio on) Try driving your normal ICE with the alternator unplugged, you will surprise yourself how short a journey you can do.

Found the 12v battery gauge but did not fancy using it as the cable was frayed so spent the evening with a soldering iron.

All became clear on Sunday when I realised that the 12v battery is stuffed. I get only 11.8v or so before the DC-DC kicks in and figures north of 14v are seen, in fact concerningly enough it goes as high as 15.2v under no load conditions. Lights, wipers and blower all take their toll but the killers are PAS and rear screen demist. With everything on and waggling the steering it drops below 10v! Clearly my problem the day before was all the manoeuvring I did to get it past some parked cars in my drive.

It would seem that it only charges the 12v when the system is on (not when charging the traction batteries) and having done 100 miles or so on it now the situation with the 12v has not improved. I would have liked to charge the 12v with an external charger but it is all shrouded and the +ve terminal is buried under the scuttle. Anyway it is self evident that the 12v is stuffed so I plan to replace it tomorrow if I can figure out how to remove it, certainly it is not a straight forwards vertical lift and there is some form of control box in front of it. With that and all the shrouding it is going to be a challenge!

The car itself is a delight, much more perky than the one I test drove a couple of weeks ago. The steering is smooth and there is no problem keeping up with urban traffic, I had 65 out of it at 150A on a slight downhill. Everybody I have taken out in it laughs in disbelief at the incongruity of it wafting along in almost silence apart from the repertoire of space ship noises and my insistence that the fuel costs are 1p per mile!

I have a 12v in the garage which having been charged 3 months ago is sat at 12.9v so if that will fit it is going in. In terms of the ideal long term replacement my guess is that a leisure battery would be better suited designed for deep discharge rather than cranking amps, but I would welcome advice? I am a bit concerned about the DC-DC belting out more than 15v as this is battery boiling and bulb popping voltages, but there again the system does not currently have a good battery which may hold that down? We will see! 

The only other problem I have found is one of the fluid reservoirs has part of the cap missing (photo attached). I am guessing that it is the coolant system (does this cool the batteries when charging or the motor whilst running?). I am guessing that Allied might be my best source for this?

I hope all goes well for you with your new purchase and that it gives you good service. All going well with mine. I have found it a great insight into electric driving. Due to the constant digital reading on V and A there is a great tendency to try and ensure optimum economy at all stages of driving. I use downhills as a slingshot to build up speed and allow the car to slow down on uphills rather than try and force it at the same speed. You also become very aware of the % required to get from A to B and C to D and different driving styles makes a big difference to the %. Over the weekend we had a substantial snow and it was interesting to see how the vehicle performed, the drive does not like one wheel to spin and will trip when this happens. I had noticed this before when taking off but it also happens in braking, it requires a restart with the key. It was not particularly cold at the weekend and the snow thawed fast, if there was a good freeze I will keep the vehicle in a shed to prevent the ambient temperature dipping too low.

I am not overly concerned about range and economy as I do not have a daily commute and most of my usage is multiple, round trip, short journeys, however I am keeping a daily log of opening and closing charge and miles covered.

Today was an interesting case in point: starting charge 100%, finish charge 50%, miles covered 42 over 5 journeys. Clearly a range of 65 to 70 miles is achievable, probably more if the chosen driving style is moderated from ""spirited"" to ""steady"".

My mind is turning to home charging point provision. Currently I use a socket on the ring main in the garage and the cable that came with the car which is a 16A commando to 5 pin car plug and a short but substantial 3 pin domestic to commando socket.

I am considering an external command socket fed through a power filter, time switch and watt hour meter from a 16A breaker in the distribution panel.

The old one was a 60Ah and it just so happened that I had a good 50Ah in the garage so that has gone in ok. The new one had a resting voltage of 13v as opposed to the old one at 12.2v and now with everything on, including full speed blower and HRW, volts drop to 12.5 and 11.5 if you twiddle the steering, so that seems ok!

Still a slight concern that with system booted and all accessories off, DC to DC is pushing out 15.5 which is the highest I have ever seen on a car 12v system! Is this normal or might it lead to premature 12v battery failure?

At least now I have solved the occasional boot failure when trying to initiate with some accessories on and only 11v available!

It is a Zivan NG1 supposedly set up for 50A 13.8v See Photo. This is actually a photo provided by Falcon of his, I have no reason to doubt mine is the same but I will check mine tomorrow.

It would seem from searching around that these come in an infinite variety of input/output voltages and are programmable to individual application. It is a little confusing because they seem to have AV - DC chargers that are labelled NG1 also. The UK distributor is Electrofit Zapi Ltd.

On the NG3 they have a small rotary switch that has to be set to a power supply setting, and a couple of internal pins shorted before adjusting the voltage. This is because with nothing connected the unit wont work. And with a load connected the voltage cant be properly set. This process sets the finish voltage of the CC phase (lifepo4) or first pahse of the charge, the way the charger gets there is dependant upon the internal chip that is fitted, ie PB or Lifepo4 etc. 
On the charger side the rotary switch is then set to the appropriate setting for the pack (that depends on the chip that is fitted) the internal shorting removed, and the unit will then function when plugged into the pack, with the final voltage following the desired charge algorithm. If set as a power supply, the unit will just put out the desired voltage at the current it can deliver. If you just adjust the voltage, on most Zivan its a multiturn pot, that will not be a definititive voltage but one based on the load at that point in time.

Settling in to BEV usage here. A mate asked me how I was getting on with it since I renewed the 12v battery, and I said OK it has been a case of use it, charge it, use it, charge it and use it again! It is doing pretty much as it says on the tin and proving ideal for our multiple daily journeys around town.

I had one minor slip up in it before Xmas. The book says if you run it below 20% it will drop into limp home mode. Well I needed to see what this limp home mode is so I ran it a bit close to the wire and hit 20% at about 1 mile from home. It does not limp so much as crawl at about 3mph and if you try to push it even slightly it trips. So I crawl, trip, crawl tripped into a side street and called for a tow. I am planning for a sign on the dashboard saying ""If state of Charge hits 21% then park!"". Lesson learned!

I am logging daily mileage and the start and finish charge %. So far it is averaging 1.37 percentage points of charge per mile. The first 15 to 20% burn off quite quickly then the consumption levels off a bit. Curiously the % per mile figure has an improving trend, is this because the batteries are benefitting from regular cycling or because I am adapting my driving style? So far I have done 520 miles and I calculate that the average max range is 58.5 miles. I will share this data when I have more of it!

And so to the DC-DC converter. Still running at a no load voltage of 15.2 to 15.5 and if to prove the point it blew a headlamp bulb over the holidays. Mind you with the dipped beam on the volts drop to 14.8v.

Thanks Jeremy the photos are attached.

The location of the converter, which you may recall is in the load area in a plastic box ventilated by a single 30mm hole in the end of the box opposite the fan of the device, remains a source of irritation for me and I aspire to hiding it elsewhere in the bodywork. The cavity behind the panel to which the box is attached would be ideal but it is a bit small for the Zivan.

I am a little concerned that the capacity of the Zivan is a little low and if the voltage has been cranked up (since it was tested in 2012 to get more current out of it. I can not help but wonder if there is a DCDC out there that has a slightly higher capacity in a slightly smaller footprint? Yeah I know, if it is not broke don't fix it!

Whoa!!...

I read this in your post first thing this morning and thought ""I never saw that!"".

This is exactly what happened to me in the e-Expert, but at just under 30%. However in this case @Mike Schooling has identified some cells have become imbalanced (plus 'other things').

But I have now dug out my book, which also covers e-Partner (same manual by the look of it) and all it says in mine is 'avoid running the battery down to 0%'. Nothing about 20% being a cut-off.

Your comment makes me wonder if, possibly, they have implemented some re-programme, while I still have the 'old' book. Difficult to tell with these low cells. I get 1 mile per % and am really hoping to have an occasional 100 mile range from it.

I carried on to get home, with it letting me drive a little less each time, covering 4.5 miles overall from the first 'trip' in about 5 ever-shortening hops. I'm wondering now if it is just the way the system responds to low battery voltage, or whether it is actually a programmed feature!",1,220755

Donald, the reference to 20% is in the allied drivers manual which I shared in an earlier post (page 5 of the thread) where it says.......









So it looks as though we were in the hands of the battery safety system! Mine was being particularly cautious and I only managed about half a mile during which the SoC dropped to 18% before I gave in. No other warnings came upo on the panel.

I do not have the allied vehicle manual which you seem to have just unearthed, do you by any chance have a scanner?

It looks like my % per mile is a little low. It is unclear if it is my driving style or some issue with the batteries, part of the problem is the chequered history these vehicles have had, who knows how long they have been stood around and what affect that may have had on the batteries. Last year min did 250 miles between MOT's!

OK, so we are looking at the same manual, but different parts of it/different interpretations.

On page marked '6', 'best practice' it also says ""Battery life will be enhanced by avoiding running down to 0% SOC."" implying that running down to 0% is possible.

I don't think these statements are contradictory, but it alludes to a somewhat miserable outcome.... It seems to be saying that once you get down to 20%, you may get a battery safety cut-out.

In other words, you can't depend on these vehicles at low SOC. If the cells are imbalanced, as mine are right now, then it's going to flunk out quickly. As most of my cells are still showing respectable charge levels, if it wasn't for the few duff ones then it probably would have carried on down to lower SOC.

If I had known all of this, then I could have simply charged back up when I got home that one time and not needed to recover it to @Mike Schooling . However, as it has resulted in Mike doing a safety inspection (well-needed, as it turns out) of the front pack, I guess it is not altogether a bad outcome.

What it does perhaps illustrate, though, is that you are better off with cells in parallel sets, than this setup of single large serial cells where just one cell in the serial chain will create uncertainty at low SOC, and kill your range stone-dead in an unexpected instant!",0,220920

Most EVs have some sort of cut back at low SOC, many vehicles dont let you get anywhere near the last few % but make you believe that 0% is empty but the pack actually is at perhaps 20% so preventing you taking the pack into the zone of potential problems. This is more important when the BMS is of a top balancing regime, as the bottom end will reflect the actual imbalance of the pack and so give a greater chance of early (ish) cut out. The C1s cut back first at around 20% to 3000rpm, then at about 15% to 1500rpm.That can be changed but its also a good way of causing damage to the pack.

According to the Thundersky spec sheet, more than a half of my cells still have 20%-odd of working charge left, but a couple have dipped below 2V. It is frustrating that the balancing has not worked out, but maybe it is just a case of rigorous and healthy charging protocols. We are hopeful these cells will recover, LFP is a robust chemistry. I fear these are weak cells and will need replacing if the maximum range is to be realised.

There are also questions hanging over exactly whether the balancing process is actually working properly as the settings seem all over the place, originally saying something like balancing level of over 4V, which is obviously not appropriate for LFP batteries.",1,None

Name: Unnamed: 0, dtype: int64",775,"Jan 6, 2016","Thats exactly what you get with a top balanced pack, and why you would cut back at around 20% You only want to use that 20% because you know its there. Thats why mainstream cars dont let you tink you have it. It also means they can to a degree hide the range loss over time as in % terms its actually much less if you can only see 80% of the pack in the first place. I much prefer bottom balancing, but its then not really possible to do any balancing once the pack is in use.You also have to not seek to get the last few ah out if the pack, and effectively under charge a small amount. But you do end up with a pack you can take way down with limited chance (unless a cell goes wrong) of taking cells low. Again thats where the damage takes place. No charge regime is perfect. When I rebuild a car I always bottom balance the pack, and then I can find any cells that are seriously under capacity and replace them. I know how many AH I have put into the cells, and so what their capability is. Only when they are charged do I do a load test, and again if any dip especially they get changed. The result is the best balanced pack I can get. If you then go on to top balance its makes little difference, but at least the BMS has some ability to pick up the faults in the future. By always bottom balancing to the same voltage, for the same cells, It matters not a jot if I get 155ah into a 160 ah cell, if they are all close to the 155 then all is good. Between bottom balance voltage and zero is probaly much less than 5ah, about the same as not taking a thundersky to 4v but cut off at 3.65v The ah that goes in between 3.6 and 4v is really small and very variable. But thats where top balancing does its work. 
So accept the 20% is out of your access and then your range is based upon whats left.

There was no may about it for me, I believe it is programmed in. Knowing I was sailing close to the wind I was watching the SoC closely and with some trepidation as I was on 21% and climbing a moderate hill! The first trip was simultaneous with the SoC hitting 20%. I managed it to the top of the hill and then did 600mt on the flat before it became untenable and with a major set of lights ahead, I sought refuge in a side street. That 600yds dropped the SoC a further 2% points! I just towed mine home and charged it (single phase), it is evident that the battery had been well flattened because 8 hours later it was 100% but still drawing 3A.

This raises another question in my mind. If cells are weak or imbalanced you could assume that the max SoC would be affected i.e. after a full charge you might only see 95% and declining as the battery degrades. But it would seem that a SoC of 100% means 100% of what might be a reduced capacity and so the % per mile is greater and the dreaded 20% comes sooner? By this logic a seriously compromised pack would still charge to 100% but it would not get you very far on a full charge and cause tripping sooner than the programmed in 20%.

I could take some comfort from this and conclude that my pack is relatively OK and conclude that the modest range I am experiencing is due to my right foot!",0,220943

WIth the curtis controller this is a voltage threshold for the pack, at which 100% is set. Many of the Hall effect current flow measuring devices are poor at bi directional current flow, and so can get out of sync. Some systems use two one for each flow direction to combat this. Hence why the likes of Curtis enable a definitive point to be a reset, but on the C1s a poor cell will often trigger the charger to shut down at a soc of 95% .
Top balancing also enables a degree of over charge (on the measurements/ data not the actual cells) to compensate for the in accurate measurements. We all like to think this is a precise science, but it isnt. The fact we can have BMS that measure to three decimal places of a volt and that we can have a threshold to a 3 decimal place gives a false sense of security. But each cell is different. Under load, under charge, hot cold, etc etc etc. So whatever approach you take its a compromise. But if you try and get the last ah out of a pack, you will always be disappointed.

Sorry to be the bearer of bad news Donald. There are 2 e-Experts on ebay now, only one of them quotes a range of 75 to 85 miles; and 2 e-Partners indicating 80, 85, 90 miles. I was under no illusions when I bought mine and understood that absolutely best case scenario range might be 90 miles but that realistic worst case was 60miles. I am sure that If I drove mine flat out fully loaded I would get no more than 45.

My current record is 52 miles on a full charge with 4 persons in the car and a lot of shopping, I made it home on 26% little realising at the time how close I was to embarrassment. I might have made it to 55 miles before having to park!

Interesting, I was going to mention this at some point but under my bonnet between the battery and the osf inner wing there are what looks like mobile phone and GPS aerials.

Zivan chargers have a built in Surge protection circuit, that can get obliterated if there is a real significant spike/surge, but is fully repairable, and a very responsible addition to the chargers. I have seen dozens and dozens of Zivan NG3s and only a few with faults, even these can generally be repaired by the importers, but for me its often not worth spending cash on a used charger. They do however stipulate that they will not accept any warranty claim if the unit has been used on a generator, so be warned. If you ask for supply for such use they will refuse. Probably because the surge / spike sections get blown.
If you ever think about using a generator only ever use the sort of thing they use at Festivals, ie the size of an outside toilet laid on its side. Or a well oversized inverter generator. These use a simple DC generator and then create a pure sine wave (assuming its a decent bit of kit) with the inverter section. But a good one is very expensive compared to many of the cheap gennies on the market. My own good experience is with 6kw Honda inverter gennies, but they are costly.
A spike suppressor wont allow you to get away with a really poor generator, so all of us in the rural settings be warned, dont be tempted. Its not worth it.

Picked up my E-Partner late Saturday afternoon in torrential rain had a quick acclimatisation in the car park and then got it home OK where everything went a bit Pete Tong with random error messages and flashing lights. Found the 12v battery gauge but did not fancy using it as the cable was frayed so spent the evening with a soldering iron.

All became clear on Sunday when I realised that the 12v battery is stuffed. I get only 11.8v or so before the DC-DC kicks in and figures north of 14v are seen, in fact concerningly enough it goes as high as 15.2v under no load conditions. Lights, wipers and blower all take their toll but the killers are PAS and rear screen demist. With everything on and waggling the steering it drops below 10v! Clearly my problem the day before was all the manoeuvring I did to get it past some parked cars in my drive.

It would seem that it only charges the 12v when the system is on (not when charging the traction batteries) and having done 100 miles or so on it now the situation with the 12v has not improved. I would have liked to charge the 12v with an external charger but it is all shrouded and the +ve terminal is buried under the scuttle. Anyway it is self evident that the 12v is stuffed so I plan to replace it tomorrow if I can figure out how to remove it, certainly it is not a straight forwards vertical lift and there is some form of control box in front of it. With that and all the shrouding it is going to be a challenge!

The car itself is a delight, much more perky than the one I test drove a couple of weeks ago. The steering is smooth and there is no problem keeping up with urban traffic, I had 65 out of it at 150A on a slight downhill. Everybody I have taken out in it laughs in disbelief at the incongruity of it wafting along in almost silence apart from the repertoire of space ship noises and my insistence that the fuel costs are 1p per mile!

I have a 12v in the garage which having been charged 3 months ago is sat at 12.9v so if that will fit it is going in. In terms of the ideal long term replacement my guess is that a leisure battery would be better suited designed for deep discharge rather than cranking amps, but I would welcome advice? I am a bit concerned about the DC-DC belting out more than 15v as this is battery boiling and bulb popping voltages, but there again the system does not currently have a good battery which may hold that down? We will see!

The only other problem I have found is one of the fluid reservoirs has part of the cap missing (photo attached). I am guessing that it is the coolant system (does this cool the batteries when charging or the motor whilst running?). I am guessing that Allied might be my best source for this?

So I have joined the wold of BEV and so far I am well chuffed! Just off to put my new baby on charge on economy 7 at 6p per kWh.

I have a Allied Peugeot partner Tepee which came with only the 1P commando lead and a short UK 3pin to commando socket adaptor. I have been using the car on almost a daily basis quite successfully within it's full charge range (c60 miles although my max has been 56!) and then charging it overnight on economy 7 via a 3kW domestic plug in time switch. The socket on the time switch does run a little warm especially on a long charge (can be 9 hrs) after a full discharge the day before.

I have happily avoided travelling further afield on the basis of ""charge availability anxiety"" and in any case it seems a little unfair to thrash the poor thing at motorway speeds, so for longer trips I use ICE.

However I am intrigued by the concept of off base charging and would be quite amenable to giving it a go except for the fact that I am completely innocent of all the variety of charging stations and cables that might be required, and whether public charging facilities are free or what mechanisms there are for paying. If someone could give me (or point me at) an idiots guide to BEV changing with particular reference to the cables/adaptors required for the partner I would be obliged.

On a related subject. we are due to move house shortly and I will need to install an external charge point at the new house which I would like to future proof so it can be used by any EV. I am guessing that I would need to install a 32A point even though the current car will not benefit from this. Any pointers in this regard would be equally welcome.

The lead is a type two to the red allied input. There are two leads one long which gives 3 phase (2222kw will charge at 20amps) another lead attaches to this lead and can be used on single phase these are the 7 kw fast chargers and much the same as the standard plug charges at 8 amps.

Having read the above thread, I feel a little clarification is needed.

As I understand it (and I don't profess to know all about this subject so, please don't take it as Gospel and if anyone who has more knowledge on the subject, please feel free to add to or correct what follows)...

1/ The Allied conversions of Peugeot vehicles use the Italian EDN CMP253-02 charger. I have posted the manual for this earlier in this thread (page 3).
2/ This works at either 16A (3.34kW max), single phase (1P) 230VAC input or 3 phase (3P) 15A (per phase) 415VAC input (9.3kW max). However, the output power is shown in the manual as 3 and 7.6kW respectively.
3/ Assuming the smaller Allied-converted vehicles will do approximately 3 miles to the kWh, a 1P charge rate will give about 9 miles per hour of charging and the 3P one, 22mphc.
4/ Bearing in mind that the battery pack is at a higher (DC obviously) voltage than the charger input, these two charging rates will appear on the vehicle's dash display as maximums of (DC or 'battery amps') 8A and 21A, respectively. The battery management system will limit the charger output current according to the state of charge (SOC) of the pack, the higher the SOC, the lower the output current. For reference, the Peugeot Partner Tepee, has a 24kWh battery pack at a nominal 280v (84 X CALB 90ah cells - according to a source at Allied).

So, if you can access 3P power you get more than twice the charging rate than the 1P option.",0,None

The cell capacity value is anything you want it to be, but it is what the ECU uses to show up the %age battery remaining. Once the pack is fully charged it resets to 100%, then it seems to do some sort of Coulomb counting.

It is not beyond impossibility that someone has set it low to accommodate some battery degradation and show a reasonably useful screen display. The indicator will get to 0% quicker with the lower cell capacity set. What you need to do is to run it down to whatever you usually do, then take a log of the cell voltages and figure out what is going on with them.

I was told by Allied that, for all their vehicles, those with both single and 3 phase chargers were fitted with two chargers.

I have another one.......
Has anybody got a contact at Allied that could possibly help on the topic of Partner Tepee rear springs? I think I am building up to needing a new pair. I have investigated the possibility of having air ride suspension fitted and in the process acquired a DriveRite fitting manual. This has given rise to a few issues :

Is the rear suspension Standard Peugeot (I would assume so although I guess stronger springs may have been used given the up-plating of the car to 2305kg MGW)
The preferred position for the DriveRite control box is behind the trim panel in the NSR load area just where the DC/DC converter is fitted. (It is my ambition the relocate the DC/DC due to its incursion into the load area anyway)
The chosen location for the pump is under the bonnet in front of the 12v battery where there is a space on the ICE version, on mine this is taken up with some kind of controller box but there may be room to mount it on top requiring a mounting frame.
The ride height setting given in the installation manual is 450mm from centre of wheel to lip of wheel arch. Obviously this is for a standard car, it may be that with the higher kerb weight of the ePartner results in a different setting. The measurement on mine empty (apart from 350kg of battery pack!) is 375mm. (This may well be important because I think that there is a ride height sensor that affects the front/rear brake balance
I do not have a cost for this yet but it may well be prohibitive!
In light of 5 above what specification of coil spring is standard for this car as it will probably be much more cost effective just to replace the rear springs maybe even with uprated ones?
I attach the DriveRite manual below for everyone's general interest (well I intended to but it is too large at 6gB, I tried splitting it but still too big, I will try again later) . The installer has posed some of the above questions and doubtless when I get back to him he will quote a price, which I will share!",0,None

Depending on what that means for your van, that might mean the addition of a spring in the middle of the main, standard spring. So you get two springs inside each other. If that's the case you won't be able to fit the DriveRite as that goes where the booster spring goes, and you'll alter your GVM and ride height.",0,None

If so it is the plate on the vehicle that determines the GVM not the springs although it is to be hoped that, in increasing the MPM (maximum permissible mass) as shown on the V5, Allied fitted some uprated springs. However we have no way of proving that without asking the question, they may have just left the originals in place? Certainly there is no spring within spring arrangement visible on mine. 

My V5 Tells me that my vehicle make is ""Allied Electric"" with no type, variant, version or model which is pretty weird. It says that the MPM is 2305kg and the Mass in Service is 1810kg which gives a payload of 495kg (mass in service is defined as 90% fuel load and 75kg for the driver (a slight under allowance in my case I am afraid)). So if I was carrying myself as driver and 4 similar 100kg persons and 70kg of luggage I would be at MPM.

When fully loaded like this the car trails its arse on the ground (metaphorically!) and bobbles along like Zebedee i.e. bounces off its bump stops over minor bumps in the road! No body roll though because it is riding on the bump stops! Also as I said in OP I understand the un-laden rear ride height should be 450mm and it is actually 375mm. This answers the question as to why I feel I need to replace the rear springs!

If I go to a motor factors and ask for a pair of rear springs for my reg number they will find that it is a 1.6 hdi Diesel and give me the springs appropriate to a 2060kg MPM! The range for the tepee is from 2000kg, up to 2200kg for the 7 seat variant and even the springs for this would be insufficient for my ""Allied Electric No Model""! 

I think that I will have to take my life in my hands and call Allied for advice, either that or a replacement spring specialist like Grayson Engineering.

Name: Unnamed: 0, dtype: int64",775,"Apr 22, 2016","Air suspension is actually a fairly simple solution, and can be readily fitted with the associated parts mounted in many places. You dont need to have complex air compressors and valves, but just choose to set the air pressure by use of a simple air valve as per a car wheel. You set the pressures and forget it. You only need the compressor and valves if you need to constantly change the load or ride height. The air valves also have a tendancy to leak, so meaning you have no choice but to reset the levels. But its also worth looking at the PSA parts lists for alternatives. As an example one of my customers who has air spring assist on the rear of their Berlingo (older version) electrique, also found that there was a much higher capacity version of the van sold and so fitted a set of the torsion springs from that version as well. As a short fix, you can also get helper springs designed for caravan users, some fit as a rubber spacer between the coils, I have used these to good effect, and a nemo conversion I have for sale as a set of these on the rear. There are also different assist devices that fit inside the coil spring. The Citroen C1s I support did have specially uprated rear springs on the version with 32 cells to cope with the weight. There are many spring makers around, but its not simple to get a good solution. Depending upon clearances, it could be possible to use an afttermarket coilover system, which would also have adjustable seats for the spring loading and height. But I have not looked under the Allied vehicles to check if its possible.
As a guide Diesel versions tend to have higher spring rates on the front, but the rear which is dependent upon the load will be unchanged, so look for a variant with a higher load capacity. (Or longer wheel base variants) Or the pickup versions not sold in the UK etc etc.
With the greater weight, its also worth looking at the parts list to see if any versions had an extra antiroll bar fitted. (The suspension beam itself acts as the normal antiroll/ torsion member). 
And lastly Shocks are really important, if you are running at a lower ride height, its highly likely that these are damaged. If you run a car with lowered springs and dont change the shocks (shorter stroke), you end up running on the internal bump stops of the shocks and can at worst burst the internal valves (Years ago I constantly did this on a lowered UNO I had, but was too tight to fit the shortened shocks it really needed). Once the ride height is sorted get the heavy duty version of the Shocks from a motor factors or motor sport parts business. WIth greater weight and higher moving mass the shocks work harder and get hotter, the oil thins and they dont work as well. If you have clearance, there are also towing assist shocks that have an air spring sleeve built in (US made Gabriel ).",0,None

The DriveRite air suspension kits in which air bags replace the coils priced up at ¬£1200 +vat and I class that as prohibitive!

Been trying for 2 weeks to get an answer out of Allied to tell me specification of springs fitted to this vehicle as part of the conversion which uprated MAM from 2060kg to 2305kg so I can buy replacements locally, but to no avail.

Ascertained that the heaviest standard vehicle in the range is Peugeot Partner Tepee 7 seater a MAM of 2200kg and priced a pair of springs up at ¬£55 but then I got lateral and spoke to Allied parts department.......

They assure me that the e-partner springs are bespoke to them and not a standard fitment in the partner range, I have ordered a pair at ¬£130 and await with interest!

Unfortunately I am in a bit of an EV support desert here in Leeds, to be honest the battery question was asked on behalf of a friend who, having seen the success of my BEV experiences is considering his options. He has his eye on one which claims to have 83 good cells and one that needs replacement (how this conclusion was arrived at is a bit of a mystery). According to the Allied brochure the cells are 110Ah 27v. My range is steadily improving with daily use and charging I regularly achieve around 60 miles with an all time best of 66 with 32% left in the tank (empty is 20% so I had about 9 miles to go!). It would be interesting to know the state of my cells but I do not have a problem as such. 

On the springs front, the Allied brochure has a tick in the box for ""Suspension Upgrade"" whereas in some of the other vehicle details the tick is against ""Suspension Upgrade Available"". Mind you for the e-partner tepee it states the MAM as being 2040kg with a note to the effect that ""uprating may be available on request"". A MAM of 2040kg would have been disappointing for a 5 seat vehicle with a mass in service of 1810kg giving a 230kg payload (the 4 passengers would need to anorexic!). So who knows what if any uprated springs were fitted as part of the conversion!?

My plan now is to wait for the new springs to arrive. I got a categorical statement from the parts man that these were uprated springs unique to the e-partner at MAM of 2305kg and only obtainable from Allied. When they arrive I will attempt to do a reverse lookup to find out just what they are based on any information on the packaging and I will press Allied technical for confirmation in writing of the facts before I fit them. If it turns out they are from a stock Peugeot model with a lower MAM then they are going back!

When I fit them I had thought to fit some assisters also as belt and braces. The in coil rubber block type have always seemed to me to be potential coil snappers and so I will be looking for the air bag type as per the link as these are at least adjustable.

Last month I take the adventure to Import a ePartner to Germany. I think it is the first Allied in Germany. The car drives very well (over 500 miles) so far, but since yesterday I have a Problem.
If I loaded the car (Phase 1) after a while the load-process was braked up sometimes. I can reset the Controller (breakdown the mass cable of the bord battery) and the load process continues but later it stopped again The Display shows then 0A and 0V.

The green control lamp in the allied Display change to red and than no Propulsion. I had the same Problem for a few day but there were the carge of the traktion batterys low. After a breakdown and a subsequently fully load was always OK. But now nothing works.
Is it possible that the 12V board battery is too flat that the Controller for load and traction doesn¬¥t work and so Comes the disorder? The Voltmeter on board Shows a voltage between 12,7 - 13,4V on drive but after the car stopped 12,1 V!

The '0V 0A' is a quirk, ignore it. Assuming it is like mine, it will continue to charge even though it says 'STOP 0V 0A'.

Ignore this.

The BMS is totally separate to the display screen in functionality. What is happening is some corruption or time-out between the battery signals and the display screen.

Is the one phase charger on board air cooled? Can you tell if it is running (by the fan running?) If so, you must complete the charge until the fan stops.

I would strongly suspect you have a low cell. The % shown is NOT a display of state-of-charge, it is a display of kWh used. this means that it can still show a large % but actually one of the cells has gone critically low.

I had this fault. One of my cells was completely flat but the display was still reading 37%. I did not realise the low cell.

For this reason, you MUST charge your battery pack up immediately else that low cell may drop even lower, and then you will have to have it swapped for another new cell. Again, this is what happened to me.

If it will not start at all now, then you will probably have put the battery into a state where it has locked'. Again (!) this is what happened to mine. Because it said 37% I assumed it was something else, so I kept restarting the van until it finally locked the battery.

When this happened I had to have it recovered to Indra renewables, who removed the pack and manually charged the low cells. in my case there were two cells low, one needed replacing. It was likely bad to start with so caused the problem.

Sorry, but you have trouble here. If you cannot recharge the battery now, then you will have to take the pack out and manually charge the cells.

First, let me know if the van charges. ignore the 0V 0A thing.

If you can charge it back up then do so. We can then talk a bit more about how to check this and fix it. If it will not charge at all, this is a problem. You need to find an EV specialist.",1,None

My e-partner has just stopped going up a hill, it's showing 40%.
I have limped it back down hill and to my local garage, now charging 13amp socket.
I assume cell(s) low, how long to temporary charge to get me home?

Sounds like you need to charge more often or top up on your route. Give it a full charge or as much as you can then a full charge (+ 12 hrs to allow final balance).
Have you considered the change of gear yet. The gear change is on the passenger side rear of the gearbox. On the Diesel version its almost impossible to see the gear change mechanism from above the vehicle. So if possible get one on a ramp and watch someone put it into 2nd gear.

Thanks for charging info.
I charged it for 4.5 hours at local friendly garage, from 40% to 75%. It normally charges about 10% per hour.
I have been charging it about every 4 days, this was the first time I let it go to 40%, only one charge to 100% in the 3 weeks I've had it. Sounds like I need to charge it to 100% more often, and not risk going too low. Normal voltage at rest about 275v, max current about 180amps uphill with voltage dropping to about 255v.
I've not had chance to look at change of gear, looks like a gardener's winter job! (wondered about re-fitting the gear change mech'm including the original knob and fitting a better electric D-N-R switch nearby, then can select best gear from in car, probably when stopped as no clutch) Lots of ideas in this great forum, wish I was retired!

Would it?

Interesting physics here to contemplate (the laws of which are not to be trifled with!).

If I floor mine at say 30mph the display usually does something like show 150A at 265V (say). If I then accelerate up to 40mph and floor it, the display will say something like 150A at 265V. If I accelerate to 60mph, the same!

The thing is... this is basically a fixed power.

If I were to manipulate the gears so that instead of 30, 40mph and 60mph it was now 22mph, 30 mph and 45mph and I floor it again at each speed, I'll still get the same power. So whether I am at 40mph in the fixed 3rd gear, or 40mph in 2nd gear, it'll still accelerate the same, it'll still pull the volts down the same, it'll do everything just the same because it is a fixed power output.

I think the differences for adjusting gears are - if a low gear is selected, you get better torque from low speed (so can climb more steeply) up to the motor delivering max power (which is around 10~15mph) but get lower top speed. A higher gear will give you worse performance in the 0~20mph range but higher top speed.

At least, I think this is what would happen. What do you say?",0,342106

Think of gears more as torque multipliers. Whatever torque the motor makes the gearing will take that up or down depending on what that gearing is. If you have a completely flat torque curve and shorten the gearing it will make it's peak power at lower road speed (but the same motor speed). If you have a completely flat power curve and shorten the gearing it will make more torque at the axle but will require more motor speed for the same top speed. 

Presuming a flat power curve, if the motor is under it's maximum constant speed (rpm) at the vehicles maximum constant speed (mph), then whatever motor speed is left is the difference in gearing it can take for the same top speed. 

Say a motor can spin and make power to 10krpm. The required road speed is 50mph but it does this at 5krpm. You could effectively double the gear reduction which (apart from the usual losses) would effectively double the axle thrust. It would still do 50mph but with twice the pulling power and twice the revs once there. 
Weather you would want the motor constantly spinning at it's maximum and what the results would be for the motor mounts/cv joints/etc are a different thing altogether.",0,342465

But y'see, it wouldn't if it had reached its constant power regime. 

In the constant torque region of the motor, yes, gearing makes a difference. This seems to be up to 15ish mph, as I mentioned. After that, if you have 40kW to accelerate the car, doesn't matter what gear you are in, you still get 40kW of power delivered, and the torque at the wheels is going to be {wheel-speed/power}, it is independent of the gearing.",0,342546

(Hill starts especially being a chalenge in this situation) Change the gearing and the motor has more chance of turning, so getting over the initial stall.
Since these like the HPEVS/ CUrtis kit are controlled by Torque control not speed control, so taking advantage of the increased torque multiplication would mean less at the motor and so less amp to deliver the movement. 
In this usage top speed also isnt an issue. 
Siraff is correct in his analysis. Overall power consumption doesnt seem to be increased, but RPM will be, which just means that the Top speed could be curtailed. 
The only other consideration with changing gear could be the issue of over regen that has caused some of these to shut down.",1,None

I'm not sure if you're getting confused here? The power can be a constant. You will still get more push for lower gearing. Take an ice as a base. Say it makes 50hp from 2000-4000rpm. As long as it can stay inside that rpm range the wheel thrust will be increased by lower gearing so if you're in 4th at 2000rpm and change to 3rd at 3000rpm the same power will give more thrust all things being equal. 
The only real issues for an ev is if that power starts tailing off or heat starts building up - though that seems unlikely in a constant power motor unless the bearings/drag factor are massive. 
This is where it gets a bit more what if. I can only presume the people who made it had targets and knew what they were doing. If it's over geared in the first place there will be a reason. That could be it was the only way to get the top speed before the power falls off. Could be to prevent heat build up. Could be for nothing more than NVH to make it more comfy for long trips. Or it could be that they used standard transmission/axle parts which can't cope with massive torque at very low rpm.",0,342569

The loads through the gearbox bearings gears etc are much greater at the higher gear than if they had used a lower one, but in practice the gearboxes dont seem to suffer from the motor torque at low speed. I doubt if a gearbox from the 1970s would have survived in the way modern gearboxes do. But thats also a consequence of the shift to lower speed higher power and torque diesel engines which put enormous strain on gearboxes, especially at low revs where they excell at flexibility for an ICE.

If the road wheels are spinning at, say, 40 radians/second and you throw 40kW into accelerating the vehicle, it matters not a jotty jot what gears are in between the motor and the road wheels, you will still generate 1000Nm at the wheels.

Y'see;-
power = rotational speed x torque

So for a constant power region of the motor's operation, and for a given road wheel rotational speed (equivalent to road speed), there will always be the same torque at the wheels.

Imagine you have your motor spinning at 1000 radians/sec, then for 40kW it will be generating 40Nm of torque. Say you gear that with a 25:1 ratio to the road wheels to get your 40rad/s wheel speed.

Now imagine swapping out that 25:1 ratio for a 'lower geared' 50;1 ratio. Now your motor is spinning at 2000rad/s, but it is now only developing 20Nm of torque, because it is constant power at 40kW. You have a 'lower gear' but now you also have a'lower torque' from the motor because it is constant power.

Only at the slower speeds where the motor is still in a constant torque region of operation (and the power is still going up with increasing motor speed) does gearing make any difference to the torque at the road wheels.",0,None

Charged to 100% until charge fully complete a few days ago, no problems, in fact seemed to drive better.
Ran it 3 days down to 70%, set to charge ec-7 but stayed at 70% in morning with just 'Stop' on display as if it had finished charge. Only did a few miles yesterday, down to 58%. Set to charge last night, same thing! Started charge again and it charged ok to 75% before needing to get off. Is it because my ec-7 is a higher than normal voltage at night that the BMS charging doesn't like, or has it now (this morning) decided it would like to start charging again for other reason?
It did cross mind that because I live up 1in4 and the first 1/4 mile is downhill, that would have overcharged my 100% batteries with the re-gen braking? Maybe I should only charge to, say, 90% from now on? or only charge to, say, 4am to 'rest' the pack for a few hours before use? See how it runs today from 75%",0,None

As I understand it there is a single phase charger on the e-Partners and I don't know much about those. I have only dealt with the Zivans which seem 'simple' and not prone to getting 'confused'.

Annoyingly, the bad packets happen so often that it basically says 'error 5' all the time, which means I can't tell if anything else is being picked up.

Anyhow, it MAY be that this other charger doesn't like seeing this error (somehow) and stops, rather than what the Zivan does which is to keep going. Sorry, I just don't know.

What I can say though is that the BMS and the central ECU which delivers the information to the display are basically totally separate. The BMS will sent a signal to the charger to throw juice at the battery pack, and AFAIK it will continue to do that until one of the cells hits the set voltage.

When one cell hits the set max charge voltage, the charging stops and the 'Coulomb counter' is reset to 100%.

So getting only 70% I would say definitely means it is not charging fully.

You need to be VERY careful performing a series of partial recharges. The % is not at all related to the battery data, it is ONLY the amount of Ah used (or put back in) since last fully charged. If you do not fully charge, as the Ah out is less than the Ah in, you will be working the real battery SOC down without knowing it.

Once you have access to this streaming data you should see the state of the battery and it will indicate whether the BMS is still expecting a charge to be coming in. If so, then it is the charger.

I am in a similar situation in that I live up in the hills and I commute down to the village (2% down, 9% up!!). In the beginning I noticed that if I cruised down the road allowing the regen braking to kick in quite a lot the car would trip after about a mile travelled and I would have to switch the ignition off fully and then back on. I put it down to the battery pack not allowing over charge. Now I ensure that I don't allow the car to regen brake that much even though my speed can be 50-55 ish and I hard brake to slow down every so often to bring the speed down again. I feel it is important to allow a full charge every night to ensure the pack balances as best as possible after each charge. It will be interesting to see the readout from the BMS that Donald has outlined for us to do. My partner says STOP from time to time also, however it continues to charge to 100%. I always took it as a stray signal. It says STOP from time to time while driving also but the little light stays green and it does not affect the drive. When I come to a standstill and swing the lever back to Neutral and back to Drive it clears itself and goes back to D as normal, again I just take it as a stray signal at this stage.",1,345788

From time to time in the early days I used to get wheel spin when starting on a hill which caused the car to trip. Hasn't happened in a long time now so I guess I have gotten used to not applying excessive throttle when taking off. Not sure if this is the same problem you are experiencing though.

Ran it 3 days down to 70%, set to charge ec-7 but stayed at 70% in morning with just 'Stop' on display as if it had finished charge. Only did a few miles yesterday, down to 58%. Set to charge last night, same thing! Started charge again and it charged ok to 75% before needing to get off. Is it because my ec-7 is a higher than normal voltage at night that the BMS charging doesn't like, or has it now (this morning) decided it would like to start charging again for other reason?

@gordonsgardens 

I think your 12V battery may have gone flat whilst charging.

This happened to me (first time) last night.

The contactors made a heavier-than-normal clock when charging started last night and I figured that was the battery was low, need to check it in the morning. By the morning it had stopped early but oddly the display was still reading. Odd because it normally times out by the morning. I disconnected the charge lead and the battery voltage slumped,. I put the RSC408 on it and plugged it back in, all was well, an error code '24' was showing.

Worth checking 12V battery voltage in this situation, if it repeats.",0,345788

Thanks. Update: I checked the timer started the charge ok, then set to do ec7 overnight, this time it charged ok to 100%. The timer is set by moving pegs in or out at the required time, (not electronic) so I set the start to a different peg in case the switching-on was an issue.
Is it good to keep plugged in to do ec7 charges even if it is showing 100% (ie when I've not used the car that day)?

 I ran into the same problem with the tappet style timer in the beginning so opted for a heavy duty timer from Amazon https://www.amazon.co.uk/Lowenergie...p_4?ie=UTF8&psc=1&refRID=20NVKN3ZMXXKVC28RGWA

This sorted out my issue of the tappets jamming and the car not charging fully. The terminals are not well designed on this timer but it was the best I could find and it hasn't missed a beat in the last six odd months. I generally just leave the car plugged in constantly when I am not using it and let the e7 kick in every night to maintain everything. Generally I drive every day but was away in January for a two week holiday so just left it plugged in on the timer. All was perfect on my return. I linked the timer with a 16 amp socket and wired in direct the surge protector out of the attached.

https://www.amazon.co.uk/gp/product/B003BIFLWK/ref=oh_aui_detailpage_o07_s00?ie=UTF8&psc=1

I use the other one in line with my original charge lead to charge in work from a standard socket. STOP appears from time to time when charging but at this stage I believe it is just the signal issue described by @donald in other posts.

Hope you are charging back up to 100% and that all is going well.",1,346394

Dirt in the fuel isnt such a problem with the burners, as it is with the fuel pumps.

Hi Mike,

Thanks for getting back to me.

I purchased a suitable serial/usb lead several weeks a go, I did try the lead and got the programme to display using PuTTY, however I was unable to stop the screen updating/scrolling, so did not do any more.

I've now tried the setup again to see if I could learn a little more as I've now got my daughters boyfriend here (bit of a wiz), however the PuTTY screen is basically blank with just a green tiny box top left hand side. Tried another lead, same result. The tablet is basically new (1st time I've used the usb port) so don't think I've got any dodgy connections.

Is the charger also controlled by the software/processor (must be I suppose)?

With regards to the 1A load, this is the current the charger falls back to, once the batteries are charged, so basically standby current. However you refer to 12V, so are there two chargers, one for 12V and one for the traction batteries?

Just wondering if its simply lost its memory like the other car you had in your yard last time I was over?

When setting the current trip I had to start/stop it quite a few time to get the current trip right. I did think at the time I should have used something else for a dummy load, hey ho....

I sometimes have hiccups, I charge from 13a plug thro ec7 timer and sometimes doesn't start charging, (tho' says it is 'in charge'), and sometimes when turn key to start it doesn't start first time if I don't hold key for long enough. It feels like both these events are because of relays not staying in if starter voltage not there for long enough or too low.
My partner has run so much better since I conditioned the starter battery and kept it in good order with good quality 12v charger, (Ring RSC408) when not using car. I also check the voltage of the starter battery with a lighter-socket voltmeter when running and sometimes directly on the battery when charging.
I'm a beginner but cheap and easy first call is check starter battery is charging when in-charge, check it is holding it's charge, (i.e. good condition), then check relays are working ok.

They appear to have used the same engine mounts as for the diesel engine, which are designed to allow a degree of compliant movement at low speeds to cushion the engine's torque pulses.

1. Replace Lovejoy coupling
Use trusted local garage - I will need parts and any safety advice
Specialist - such as yourself, bearing in mind transport cost
2. Wait to see how your solid replacement goes, fitting as above.
3. If you recommend specialist to fit, wait until anything else is needed, especially battery system related, (running so far so good, although getting errors from serial port data, see below).

Our solid replacement could be some time off. we have been let down by several gear cutters now.

I would wait and only replace it if it becomes a serious problem.

The work is not particularly specialist. it is about as involved as a clutch change on an ICE and does not touch anything HV so any garage should be able to do it.

I typically start recording before switching on 'ignition' key, in case there are any error messages on startup.
I keep it recording for a short journey to see the effect of high drains and regens on the individual cells.

I have experience with Excel and Open Office calc so can sort the data and make interesting charts, only trouble is I'm not sure what is important except to see cells balanced and none too high or low voltage, ie they should act together (voltages) with the load.

They appear to have used the same engine mounts as for the diesel engine, which are designed to allow a degree of compliant movement at low speeds to cushion the engine's torque pulses. Unfortunately this produces a mechanically resonant circuit with the Ansaldo control circuit. Finding a solution is work in progress. @Mike Schooling is having some solid motor couplings made up, and that together with making the bottom engine mount solid should help alleviate this, I think.

I am putting the Partner in local garage on Wednesday to see about gear change, check engine mounts, look at motor coupling, and see about rear spring helpers. Not planning on any work, just seeing what it looks like on the ramp with the splash guard off.
I looked under the plastic to see where the gear-change cables attached to gear-lever went and noticed the hole where they presumably went to the gearbox is filled up with cable, so it looks too difficult to re-install original gear change lever, but see if garage and I can just change to the next lower gear and see how it drives.

no haynes i'm afraid. I'm relying on garage as he has experience of the cable linkage and I don't have ramp or suitable garage. If the change is from 3rd to 2nd it will probably limit the top speed to only 40mph. If it was from 5th to 4th then that would be ideal.

The easiest way is to fit a bladder (Its actually a tubular/column ball) inside the coil spring, rather than a bellows by the side of the existing spring set-up. They can still be adjusted to suit the load inside the car. However dimensions would be required od the inside diameter of the coil spring and the height of the internal space when at the correct ride height. Costs for a pair is usually around ¬£200-¬£300

Name: Unnamed: 0, dtype: int64",775,"Mar 1, 2017","Progressive springs are used as they have an intitial softer ride that gets progressively stiffer as the suspension travel increases. The simple rubber helpers that go round and inbetween the coils (It feeds inbetween the coils for about a turn) can be a really useful alternative, and are designed for towing where extra help is useful under load/ compression. On a Citroen C1 with additional cells in the boot, using a set upped the suspension/ car height by about 10mm and about 15mm on a std car. I have put a set under a Nemo thats really low with a 32cell pack all underneath. That really would benefit from air springs. 
The air helpers are a heavy duty bag that goes inside the coil and when inflated does a lot of assistance. 
The Allieds really do sit low which is OK until you put any extra load in them then they are really resting on the bump stops.
One problem with this is its a bit like using lowering springs and not shortening the shocks, you end up knackering the shocks as they too are running on their internal end stops and at higher pressures than needed. 

The link above is good, they have a lot on offer as does Mr Markley, I personally like the simple convoluted/ donut style rather than the ones that roll over the lower half of themselves. These are used by the major car makers as they are a lot more compact than the others but if not kept clean, I have seen a few with leaks caused by grit between the over lapping rubber.
Its always a compromise, as to what will give the force you need and what space you have to fit them into. 
They have been popular with Street rod builders for years and some beautiful parts are available from the US.
The customer who has the modded berlingo also has equipped a Polaris Ranger EV with a full set of air springs, compressor, air tank etc, you can level the thing out under virtually any load however unevenly distributed, you could originally also extend it so high it dislodged the drive shafts.

Name: Unnamed: 0, dtype: int64",19865,"Mar 22, 2017","OK I am definitely not getting one of these  but...

if I did would the following be a sensible & safe solution for home charging:

We have a spare radial circuit on our economy 7 consumer unit. The consumer unit says 60A max and currently (sorry) it has the E7 immersion heater element rated 12.5A and two storage heaters connected to the other two fuses, one heater is 1.7kW and the other 2.4kW. I make that 30A total so to me that sounds like plenty spare capacity for the the third fuse/radial circuit to take 16A? I would have to swap the 15A wired fuse for a more suitable MCB but otherwise why not? Also because this is the E7 consumer unit it would only be live during E7 tariff times (perfect!) so would this work automatically, i.e. would charging on its own when the E7 kicked without human intervention, if connected hours earlier?

If so this should be a doddle to wire up as the fuse box is in the integral garage, the radial cable runs along the wall of the garage towards the garage door then goes through the wall to an outlet the other side In the porch (where we have no desire for a storage heater but the previous owners did for some reason), Cable should be long enough to run to the wall and through to the outside next to the garage door and wired to a 16A waterproof socket. Must find some form of surge/spike protection to put in the circuit though as we have a history of frequent nightly power cuts, though less so recently.

Other questions: for fast 3 phase charging at charging stations I guess this is the Type 2 43kW charge points, which seems reasonably distributed on the main road network but less common elsewhere? This would makea slow journey back to deepest west Cornwall possible over a couple of days so avoiding extortionate cost of having it trailered 530 miles to me. How can I get the seller to confirm reliably what charging capabilities the particular Partner Tepee he is selling has?

All hypothetical of course , but the answers might help others as well...

Eberspacher and other 'night heaters' are not ICEs. They are 'externally burning' and do not produce NOx or particulate matter like 'diesel engines'.

You could burn camping gas and get pretty much the same exhaust output.

My 7 seater Allied Expert is still with Mike Schooling who is due to swap over a part from a doner vehicle, and there was nothing else 'wrong' with it before that part went, so it should be good to go after that. I have had him fit a single phase J1772 charger so you can charge it at home. It is a bit slow, but will give you 50 miles range over a 10 hr overnight charge (total range is 100 miles)

It also has a hydraulic lift in the back of it. If you want to pay that sort of money, you can buy mine and drive it home.",0,696769

Dunno what externally burning means but the CO2 output must still be the same. Perhaps I should fit a wood burner? (Joke but the East German Barkas 1000cc 2 stroke triple engined vans often had some kind of burner thing fitted).

So E7 top up every night or so I guess, but what about 3 phase charging- can this be made to work with the 3 phase type 2 charge points, and what rate/time would this work out at?

It gives the original diesel model with change from standard spec: LPG conversion, (this was the only conversion their system would cope with so I phoned twice to check it was ok and asked to make a note on the policy that it was an electric conversion with Allied Electric.

I have the same experience but accepted it as a limitation of the vehicle and can offer the following:

Todays reading is taken form the Allied Electric Peugeot Partner Supplementary Operator Manual, page 24 chapter 2.6 ""Hill Starts""

Use of the controls:
The parking brake should be used when hill starting-the car:
> Pull on the parking brake.
> Slowly press down on accelerator pedal.
> When the motor traction is sufficient to drive the vehicle, release the parking brake and slowly apply more pressure to the accelerator.

Applying pressure to the brake pedal blocks the traction. As a result, the braking effect required to compensate for the slope of the road should be obtained by using only the parking brake and never the brake pedal.

Maximum slope
A vehicle with a full load is able to be started on a slope with a maximum gradient of 15%.‚Äã
My drive rises 2.5mt over 11mt which makes it a 1 in 4.4 down the side of the house and my epartner will not restart in the middle of it when empty, take a short run at it and it waltzes up no problem. I would hate to get stuck on a ramp in a multi-storey car park in it!

A 15 % gradient is 1:6 to 1:7 and curiously enough googling ""maximum slope for a car park ramp"" reveals 
Straight Ramp Slope
The recommended slope for straight ramps in situations such as:
> Half deck car parks where the vertical separation between decks is less than 1.5m, is 1:6. This relatively steep slope is only possible when using transition gradients top and bottom.
> Where vertical differences are greater than 1.5m, is not less than 1:10.‚ÄãSo perhaps my phobia of multi-storeys is unwarranted and that the epartner was designed to restart on a car park ramp!?

I also felt that part of the bucking was due to oscillation of the right foot and I find that wedging the foot against the side of the footwell helps, but this may be an illusion!

During the streaming data if you hit 'return' it should bring up a sub menu (I use TeraTerm as hyperterminal didn't allow me into the sub menu). Then '2' brings up the configuration. Don't know what a lot of them mean but could be useful if you compare against your old car. @donald started a good thread on this which may be helpful. Allied Electric e-Partner e-Expert BMS battery data monitoring.
I uploaded mine there and compared the differences with @douglas. I watched your video and it didn't appear the trip was happening at limits though. The only difference I seen comparing to my own would be that the amps rise and fall faster on yours but this may be down to driving style. Hope you find a resolution.",0,733601

I did look at @donald thread but thought best to post here for greater visibility? I am faffing about with an old desktop PC, keyboard mouse and screen because it is the only device I could lay my hands on with a serial port! Just back from my mates with a big 12v leisure battery and a 500w inverter to drive the rig on the move (no, don't laugh!). I guess you used a serial/USB adapter? I understand not all of them work, if you could tell me the make that works I could buy one, use my laptop, and not faf as much?

Thanks for guidance with regards to menus I will give it a go. My old one is at the body shop awaiting the rebuild decision (which is probably a yes!) so I could pop in and give it a go (it would look so much more professional to turn up with a laptop!)

As to driving style, it was a bit ""binary"" because I was trying to make it fault for demonstration and diagnostic purposes also I wanted it to stall where I had an escape route to get out of the flow of traffic, sudden unexpected loss of power is a but awkward halfway round a roundabout or in the middle of a junction. The previous day I took the wife to a hospital appointment and I was not trying to make it fault, it did so within 500 yards and then 8 times in 3 miles where I was willing it not to! 

There are 3 circumstances in which it faults:-

Pulling away at full throttle (about 10% of the time)
Tootling along at small throttle opening alternating just maintaining speed, drift into the overrun and it goes. 30%
On the overrun and or braking 60%
This one does seem nippier than my original one and I see higher currents both under power and under breaking so the configuration may be different.

Anyway I will go and see if my leisure battery is charged! I will report back later! Also need to finish my magnum opus on the rear suspension saga!

I bet your wife was non too impressed!! Boys and their toys 
The cable I use is UGREEN USB Serial Cable, USB to RS232 DB9 9 pin: Amazon.co.uk: Electronics
which works well on Windows 10 running TeraTerm.

Name: Unnamed: 0, dtype: int64",4286,"Apr 4, 2017","Amazon did its amazing thing and 18 hours after ordering it am possessed of USB Serial adaptor and I was able to remove the Heath Robinson mains driven PC from the car and replace it with a laptop running Windows 7. It is possible to use HyperTerminal, just download and sit 2 files in a directory, hypertrm.dll and hypertrm.exe then run the .exe.

Whilst running round in the car reading the BMS data stream to a file on the I discovered something unexpected. This car has ""hill start assist""! If you were on a slight slope in my original car then with brakes off, in drive and no throttle opening it would roll backwards, this one resists the backwards roll without any depression of the throttle. It also works in reverse facing down hill, if reverse is selected then it will resist rolling forwards, put it into neutral and it starts to roll away freely.

Anyway I digress the purpose of the exercise is to try to find out why the drive system is stalling in normal use and I now have lots of data.

Firstly I found the command menu by pressing return whilst data is streaming:-
My interpretation of what each does is in brackets

Meanwhile I will get on with looking at the BMS data. It did stall whilst I was capturing data and they should be easy enough to spot as I noticed that when the car stalled the BMS data stream stopped!",0,None

Just in case you get bored and don't manage it to the end of this post I believe there is a fault in the BMS possibly wiring to the cells in slave 2. Anyway I think it is broken and the dealer can have it back!

I contacted Grayston for springs, their reply was succinct:
""Good afternoon, We only have uprated replacement springs for your vehicle.
Part no 3107pro Progressive replacement springs. @ ¬£268.37
Please phone 0208 974 1122 to order.
Thank you, Grayston Engineering""
Anyone fitted anything cheaper that made the ride better and a little higher?
Thanks for any comments...

Apologies, I have not been on the forum for some time (other than the BMS issues with my second ePartner which intervened in the composition of this!) and it would appear that you are going down a furrow that I ploughed some time ago.

I have had an Allied epartner tepee for just over a year in which I put 10k miles on it until it was heartlessly written off in a rear end shunt a couple of weeks ago (More of which for a later post!)

If you search back in this thread for my earlier posts you will see that pre purchase I had concerns about these cars dragging their arse on the ground which they all seem to do, and post purchase I soon got fed up of it bouncing off the bump stops with any sort of load in the back. So I did some investigation starting with the recommended ride height which for the standard car is 450mm measured from the centre of the wheel vertically to the wheel arch. No load at rest mine was 375mm! 


I knew I needed new springs, the standard springs for my reg number were about ¬£50 a pair but I suspected that they would be inadequate because the in standard trim out of the Peugeot factory the Tepee has a Maximum Authorised Mass of 2060kg and the modified ePartner is plated at 2305kg some 245kg more! See my post #167 et seq.

I did some research and found that the highest MAM vehicle built by the PSA group on this chassis was the 7 seater Tepee with glass sun roof with a MAM of 2225kg 


Allied were most unhelpful and, when I asked for the specification of the springs, they refused but they did offer to sell me a pair for ¬£150. Concerned that I might be paying Allied ¬£150 for something that I could get for ¬£50 elsewhere I persevered, but in the end I gave up and bought the springs from Allied thinking that at least I could get some numbers off their springs and find out what they were.

Things got a bit more complicated when I spoke to the parts department at Allied when the guy turned to his mate and said (you will have to imagine the Glaswegian accent) ‚Äúsee them electric partners are they the same rear springs as the wheelchair conversions?‚Äù to which the answer was ‚ÄúAye‚Äù. This was a bit of a Gotcha moment because there is no way that the wheelchair conversion is the same MAM as the electric. I also had a conversation with someone at Allied who said that he doubted if up-rated springs were ever fitted to the ePartner in the first place.

When I received the replacement springs I identified them from their markings as being the 2225kg ones (part number A5102z6 and marked !5102Z6AVL 12/16)

So I made a written request for confirmation that the springs I had been sold were fit for purpose seeing that they had been supplied for a vehicle with a MAM 80kg greater than their design spec. Allied admitted that the supplied springs sere incorrect for my vehicle but that they were the only ones they had in stock, their supplier of the original bespoke springs fitted to the ePartner having gone bust. They then started to investigate and advise me on the possibility of fitting spring assisters etc but they quickly ran into the same dead ends as I had. The springs are not suited to the internal blow up bladder type of spring assisters because they are ‚Äúpigtailed‚Äù ie the coils get tighter at one end.

I suspect that this was all BS as when I got the original springs off the car they too were identified as the standard Peugot 2225kg type by the paint splodge code blue, red, green, and (separate coil) white!

Then, such a stroke of good luck! Allied found in the deepest recesses of their parts department the last ever (truth be told the only ever) heavy duty springs for the ePartner. These were duly despatched to me and the ‚Äúincorrect‚Äù ones sent back.


These new ‚Äúcorrect‚Äù springs were visibly in a different league, the diameter of the steel being obviously thicker but they bore no markings as a clue to their origin the only lead I had was the box that they were delivered in which was from ‚ÄúMad Suspension‚Äù. I called Mad Suspension and had a fascinating conversation with Clive.


Yes he had supplied the springs which I now have to Allied, twice! Firstly in 2010 and again last week! Apparently when Allied were developing the ePartner he was asked to design and supply a suitable prototype single pair of springs. These were ultimately not used and Allied returned them to Mad where they sat for 6 years until Allied called and asked for them back again, Clive was intrigued as to why but only understood when he heard my story.


So, I have the only ePartner fitted with the springs that were designed for it and they are transformative, ride height is increased to 415mm and it barely decrease with load the ride is a bit jiggly when empty and can be bouncy when loaded. I found a pair of HD shock absorbers but these are not fitted yet due to the battery pack mounting brackets being in the way of the top mounting bolts.


In conclusion what have I learned?


The Allied eParner Tepee was initially released with inadequate springs.


Allied cannot supply any springs other than the same inadequate ones as originally fitted and at about twice the price that you would pay your local motor factors for the same thing. See 5102z6 http://www.ebay.co.uk/itm/PEUGEOT-PARTNER-1-6-Coil-Spring-Rear-2010-on-Van-Suspension-5102Z6-5102Z7-QH-New-/232155030533?hash=item360d84a405:g:~0gAAOSwiONYODH-


Aftermarket spring aids are not suitable for use on the Partner other than those ‚Äúin coil‚Äù type where a wedge of rubber is jammed in between the coils. Personally I have never fancied these due to the increase strain on the coils and risk of breakage. 


A pneumatic system such as DriveRite www.driveriteair.com supplied by Automint are prohibitively expensive at about ¬£1200 plus fitting and there would be challenges specific to the ePartner due to positional clashes between the equipment fitted by Allied and that required to be fitted by the installation of DriveRite. I have the DriveRite installation instruction manual if it is of interest to anyone!?


Aliied had a bespoke spring designed but decided not to use it, Clive at Mad said that this design could be made in a minimum batch of 5 pairs if enough interested customers could be found, price TBA.


The alternative suggested by Clive is their HD progressive spring (similar to the Grayson product) and as I recall slightly cheaper but you would need to check with Clive at Mad, I am sure he would be amused to receive a call from another ePartner user! http://mad-suspension.co.uk/ 01386 882997.


I hope this is of some interest to the ePartner owners out there with saggy back ends!",2,592401

I've given up on mods for hill starts, all seem too difficult to do and not definite outcome, also not enough hours in the day! (pity I can't just put smaller wheels on the front)
The progressive springs seem a good idea, might be less bouncy than the bespoke? (I don't carry much weight - back seats are out for tools), if I get round to fitting new springs I'll post the results.

Hi Mike, thanks again for the route to the manuals, and @falcon for the supplements, good reading
I have phoned Clive at mad and he has done a bit more research, it seems Berlingo motorhome-users fit Expert springs, (HV138518), they are the same top&bottom but longer so help with the ride height. Clive can supply them at ¬£374.88 incl vat & postge. For my situation, (seats out and only carrying tools), he recommends their own progressive springs, (HV1333238, not HV-133328 as on webpage for the partner), these are not as sturdy but will still increase the ride height, and are cheaper at ¬£235.92. I forgot to ask if it would be advisable to replace dampers for heavy duty. Have to wait 'till next month to buy, and time to think about it.

Still trouble with hill starts, changed max current settings to 250/350 A warning /alarm - no difference. Not surprised now thinking, as the oscillation starts at low amps, (about 7A) The current never gets chance to get high enough to start moving.
On an average slope I can 'hold' the car on the accelerator pedal, then slowly get going. On a steep slope, (approx. 1in4) the car either goes backwards or starts bucking.
There must be a sensor or software setting that activates the cutting out (and in) of the motor, (when it detects a stall? but then why doesn't it do it when 'holding' on lesser slopes?)
I can't see a setting in the BMS data, If there is a software setting I guess it's in the drive motor controller?
Any ideas anyone?

I wanted to make sure that everything was all squared away before I replied but I can happily report that I took SF60KWY to the local car auctions to meet a transporter heading north and that I received a full refund from the dealer in Glasgow. So fair play to them, it took a little time for them to be convinced but they did the decent thing!

Subsequently I had my original one rebuilt and have been burning electric again for a week now. However, tragedy! Over the weekend I suffered ""Peugeot spontaneous coil spring snap syndrome"" and my front offside lost its top coil so I now have Clive at MAD suspension sourcing me an appropriate replacement. It went with a hell of a crack whilst manoeuvring slowly (thank God). Googling this it would appear that it is a common occurrence which usually happens overnight when the vehicle is stationary and on the 96 - 07 version it usually put the broken end of a coil through the tyre! 

I don't know if I have mentioned this before but if you google any of the Glasgow council Tepee reg numbers the original Wilsons Auction sales catalogue comes up.....
http://www.wilsonsauctions.com/media/1440607975224-vancatalouge SAT29th.pdf or http://www.wilsonsauctions.com/media/1453901745534-SATVAN30-01.pdf

Also available is the GCC vehicle list for 01/05/2014 as a spread sheet....
https://www.google.co.uk/url?sa=t&r...st.xls&usg=AFQjCNGxLAcDlp0VmcsvzEEpcvzlKs_kgw

This only lists SF60KWD SF60KWE SF60KWG SF60KWY SF60KXA SF60KXC SF60KXE SF60KXG SF60KXJ SF60KXK SF60KXL so maybe many of them had been taken out of service before that date?

Also by the way there is one for sale on ebay (well 2 actually but I am ignoring the one with 37k miles on it in Glasgow) the latest one is at ¬£4200 in Hanbury Worcestershire, 33kmiles but looks like a good one?

The book of words says that at 20% it should drop into limp home mode in order to protect the batteries and mine did exactly that although, limp home mode is vey limp! I got towed!

I had a peek and I have one too! A very nice alloy box with SD card in slot, USB ""B"" socket and LED on one side and a multi pin connector on the other side. A very well made piece of kit, mine was not plugged in so I reasoned that no dogs would be woken up or cats killed if I was to remove it (held in with Velcro so removal not technical!)

The 1gb card contains only a 1gb file named regno.dat this takes ages to load in notepad so eventually I imported it into excel but it is all in gobbledygook. I got brave and plugged the box into my PC thinking it might power it up but no luck and the PC did not recognise it as a device.

I think this is definitely part of the remote diagnostics set up which is referred to in the original brochure which is held at http://www.batteryvehiclesociety.org.uk/bvsorguk/downloads/Allied Electric Brochure.pdf

This refers to ""The Z Factor""
""Allied Electric‚Äôs unique remote electronic diagnostic & management system.

It would be quite interesting if this could all be reactivated however I searched tinterweb for ""zWeb"" and found absolutely nothing relevant!

Glad to see I am in good company, mine lost almost the whole top coil. But all is well now with a pair of front springs as fitted to the 800kg van and new strut top bearings the steering is silky smooth and the ride seems more ""poised"" (difficult to describe but I guess the old springs were tired in addition to one having broken).

On the charging cable front I believe I have the autoswitching 1/3 ph charger although I only have a 1ph cable, the big red 5 pin connector plugs into the car and the other end is a 16A commando. I do have a domestic 13A to Commando socket short adaptor cable which gets little use since I installed a DIY 16A charge point with commando socket.

I have no experience of using public charge points at all but guess I am limited to 3kWh square pin as things stand (are there any that have 16A commando?). I guess it would be useful to be able to adapt to type 1 and type 2 sockets to be able to use 3kWh type 1/2 and 21/43 kWh type 2 (although as I understand it the car will not draw 7kWh per phase). I am unclear as to whether it would be best to adapt to the sockets or to the tethered plug on charge points (do they all have both or does it vary?) and I understand some wizardry is required to stimulate the charge point to start supply?

What would it take to give the maximum coverage on charging options and would changing the socket on the car be part of that plan? 

Thanks

Its not actually easy to wire the std charge vehicle inlets so that it could use single and three phase, because of the way the charger is wired.
The large three phase cable isnt a cheap option, the cable is quite costly, so if you are happy just to use single phase, you could have a public charge connector to a 16a blue socket and plug you r lead into it. Otherwise its a Three phase 5 pins socket on the charge adaptor, a short lead to swap the cables internally and a long three phase cable to the van.

Looking at the Aux battery it was only just above 12v and soon rose when turned on, but would drop a lot when the steering was moved (Hydraulic pump load) The charge really didnt go above 13.3v . I then raised the output voltage from the DC to DC to around 14.2, and this improves the situation. On charge the aux has a small 12v (ish) DC power supply that puts out up to 8 amps, but this really didnt seem to add a great deal to the battery voltage. This appears to be because main rad fan runs all the while the charger is operational, and so takes all the 12v charge power. 
The owner is an infrequent driver and may leave it a few days. He has had to purchase another12v battery to in effect jump start it to get it home. So the plan is to add an extra cable to behind the passenger seat (Rear seats removed to take a Dog cage) where the additional 12v will reside. I t will be pluggable with an Anderson connector, so can be simply added to the circuit if it does fail at any point, it can also be charge that way. But to deal with the unused time and voltage drop, we are going to install a 12v disconect in the front panel, that the owner can raech from his whhel chair. So when leaving it unused off charge for a few days, he can turn the 12v aux battery off.
I am also going to reccomend fitting a new thermo switch to the charger so that the rad fan does not run all the while. This should also help the aux battery get a rising voltage.",0,None

You might want to consider upping the voltage on the DC to DC converter, relatively easy to do , but not for the poor of sight or ham fisted. Its fiddly.
Also when they are on charge its a very small power supply that feeds the 12v system and barely charges the battery. Personally I would consider a small permanent 12v battery charger, and charge the 12v separately on a regular basis.
I did price up a second battery for a customer that was located behind his passenger seat (His rear seats were removed for his use) and was to be connected by using 50a Anderson connector. This meant he could simply plug in an extra battery when the main one went flat. Also he could use that connector to plug in an extra charger back to the original battery.

Further issues 

I drove car all week and on Friday left car as I was away on Saturday I charged the car Aux battery throughout the day and then left the lead off 

On Tuesday I reconnected the lead and it did not get to 13.7 -14.3 (aux battery charge level)

I left the battery on charge last night and on the charger itself it said full battery. 

On trying to restart again aux battery showing around 12.5 not enough to start 

In the usual start up process the aux charge goes to 13.9 to 14 and there is a sound from the DC to DC converter located on the nearside rear side of the boot area. There is no sound coming from this. 

Its pretty frustrating because the drive batteries have not lost any of there charge and before this everything has been working well 

If the aux battery is full why is it showing 12 on charger monitor or is the DC to DC converter not working properly

I am at the stage of thinking of sticking it on EBay any idea what I should put this up for as apart from this issues everything else is working really well.

When driving the DC to DC is powered by the main pack and is brought on line once the pack is live, ie ign turned and the vehicle has powered up.
The 12v battery is heavily used and often struggles to deliver the required load in normal conditions. The worst load being the hydraulic power steering.
When charging the vehicle, the main pack is charged, but the 12v is barely touched having just a small 12v power supply to make sure there is enough 12v supply to run the main battery pack systems. Its less than 5 amps and is often set not much above 12v. It wont charge a low level of charge 12v battery.
This means if the vehicle is then left unplugged the 12v will continue to be used by the Vehicle systems, (Radio central locking etc) as well as the BMS etc. This meanss the 12v will get flat over a few days if not used.
I have suggested to people that they use a separate 12v charger to ensure the 12v is charged when the vehicle is charged.
On an expert I am working on I have installed a system (Used it on other EVs before) that monitors the 12v battery and when it hits 12.2 v (Ideal for least sulphation, so Im told) for 20 seconds (allows central locking to dip the voltage and recover) it turns on the main system, and therefore the DC to DC for two hours. It is disabled by cycling the Ignswitch before using the vehicle. It does need some extra control added to turn off the hydraulic power steering pump which is currently running with no load, not a big deal but wasting power and an annoying noise.
A good condition and adequately sized 12v battery is vital to these vehicles. You probably have a problem with the 12v battery . Keep the meter on the 12v through the turn on cycle and see how it drops . It may be going just too low when initially loaded.
12v supply is really important to these vehicles, and the simple addition of an extra 12v charger does make a difference.
Also check the voltage of the 12v when the systems are up and running, often this is not really set high enough and is loafing just over 13v, ie not really charging , which will drop heavily when using the steering and lights etc.Do check the 12v battery voltage, and see what its doing.",1,None

Well my little old tepee made it to 50k!! Glad the temperature is starting to rise again. No fun driving this car at low temps, the cells have no stamina and the voltage drops fast when I exceed 100 amps. Strangely I still get roughly the same distance per percentage used but I don't go below 35% as cell voltage starts to drop dangerously low uphills. Still sufficient for my everyday commute so will be interesting to see how much more mileage is in the pack. Haven't got a chance to plug in a laptop and check readings in a while but will do so soon now that outside temperatures seems to be a bit higher. Out of interest has anyone put up much higher mileage than this on any of the Allied vehicles?",0,None

Name: Unnamed: 0, dtype: int64",4286,"Mar 27, 2018","Sorry for not contributing for so long but I have had little to no problem with mine (touch wood) and family health issues and life in general have been quite distracting of late. I came on the forum to check the wiring on my charge cable having used it unsuccessfully as an anchor and couldn't resist a read through since my last post. Otherwise mine continues in daily use routinely covering 40 to 60 miles in a day, very occasionally more if I give it a daytime top up! 

Golden rule number 1 ePartner's need an excellent 12 battery, not one that appears to be ok but a known good one! My first one lasted almost 2 years and I recently replaced it with a Bosch. Any strange behaviour on the part of the control systems of the car can usually be resolved by replacing the 12v! 

Anyway. sorry to hear of your troubles Gordon it is a shame you have had to let yours go. Are you at liberty to divulge what the new owners plan might be? When mine got written off I bought the salvage with a view to rebuilding it or using the battery pack (28kWh) to store juice off my PV roof installation (as seems to be all the rage now!). In the end I was able to have it rebuilt at reasonable cost and to a high standard by a local body shop and it has been fine since (again, touch wood).

In the process of negotiating return of the second one to the now mythical man in Glasgow he said something odd to me. It seemed to him that of all the ones he had sold, those that were driven away or transported flat on a trailer seemed to be problem free, it was the ones that left him on a car transporter that seemed to develop problems on arrival! My first one came on a transporter but it was on top and so carried flat, the second one came 200 miles in a 45 degree nose down position on the lower deck and that was stalling repeatedly having allegedly been fine before loading. (!?)

As to bumpy roads causing problems, mine was sideswiped on the rear o/s quarter which was repairable, then rear ended on the self same corner hard enough to result in a ¬£4500 rebuild quote which wrote it off and yet the battery pack, control gear and electronics were not adversely affected.

A couple of times I have thought it may be a laugh to try to trace all of the production run of ePartners (50 of them?) and see what has become of them. A lot of reg numbers appear on some auction house catalogues (as mentioned earlier on in this topic) and I have listed every one I have had contact with or seen on ebay in a spread sheet. Oh no does that mean I have trainspotting tendencies!? I know a couple went off shore because the man from Glasgow told me that he sent mine to Leeds on a trailer that was destined for Tilbury with 2 that were being shipped to St Lucia or thereabouts! 

I notice that PSA announced their own factory built version of the Allied product but not yet available in the UK! Not sure that it will be worth the price but in 5 years time there may be a second hand market!?

It is interesting that I presume Peugeot learned from the work that Allied had done with the Partner and developed their own range of vans, but as far as I can see did not do this with the Expert!?

The ePartner is a unique EV in being a large roomy 5 seater estate car with van capability (seats folded or out) and a diesel heater and I find it ideal as a second round town car within the constraints of range and slow charging. So much so that I considered that its ultimate replacement for me might be the crew cab version of the PSA ePartner offering, then I saw the new ePartner Tepee (not that I have seen one in the UK or been able to find its price!?)

Is the new owner going to use the battery bank or try to get it back on the road? Do you plan on going electric again, I figure when second hand five seater e-nv200's go sub 10k I might switch across. No need for rapid here and 70 - 80 mile range is perfectly acceptable.
I bought my partner cheap as a tinker project with low expectations and was lucky to get a solid one, it had 17k on the clock so I think a lot of the kinks were ironed out of it, no doubt Glasgow City Council had left it back in multiple times with issues and in those days Allied were willing to deal with them and learn how to improve the systems. The e-experts and e-monarch's seemed to be particularly problematic and I wonder were they the first to be engineered with the e-partner and e-bipper to follow.
For me the e-partner has been the perfect family/farm car and all it has needed has been tyres, antifreeze and lots of red diesel to keep the whinges in the back warm!!
I think the big shame is that Allied had developed such a bad taste from the backlash from Glasgow City Council that they weren't willing to support the cars beyond that contract. The market had changed and they were never going to compete against the major car manufacturers. Non the less it was a brave step into the unknown for a non car manufacturer company and probably one that unfortunately lost them a lot of money. Still seem to be doing well at the conversions though.
Two and a half years down the line and it has been a very interesting experience for me, the car is now in its twilight and it is interesting to experience an old electric car. I compare it to an old phone, the batteries don't last as long as they used to and put it under pressure and it dies fast. Still, a car, like a phone becomes part of you are you start to appreciate their little idiosyncrasies and realise you will be sad to see it go!!
One of my favourite parts of the experience has been the whole speakev site and especially this forum, credit to all that post and a special thanks to the experts on here who were always willing to give your time and knowledge when we needed it most.
Mike, good to hear you are still clocking up the miles and I hope family health has returned to an acceptable equilibrium for you. I agree that the partner is a great second car and its size is what makes it, there is still no electric car available in this range. It will be interesting to see how the new PSA tepee does when it is released. It is the perfect car for a family who needs a van from time to time. I have fitted in a large lawnmower, 6 lintels, a calf, roll of 6"" land drain, sheets of ply, corrugated iron, furniture, go kart etc and have been able to close the boot lid every time! The eNV200 is honestly a bit big but all that's out there at the moment.

Curiously I bought mine at 17529 miles and you may well be right that the higher mileage ones received more attention and corrective work by Allied than the 5000 miles specimens that were available. The second one I nearly bought had 5000 on it and clearly had a major technical BMS issue, a lucky escape there I think!

If the person who bought Gordon's is a tech wiz and can sort it maybe if he is active on the forum he may contribute to the sum of knowledge that has been built up and the mileage record you have achieved may well be broken?

Maybe yours has had a harder life than mine which today stands at 33373 miles but I have yet to detect any fall off in battery capacity. For two years I plotted daily journey length against % of battery used and when I started I thought the batteries were getting stronger because there was a steady but slight upward trend, then I realised that it was the battery efficiency rising with the passing seasons into summer where once I managed 84 miles on a single charge! But even on the direst, coldest, fully loaded days it has never failed to deliver at least 60 cheap and silent miles! 

Idiosyncrasies? I enjoy the space ship noises on initialisation (as do the grand kids) and the max torque at zero revs feature that makes it set off like a startled shark with an instant response when you plant the go pedal. The fact that it can do an over-torque cut out if you hit a wet piece of ironwork whilst launching can be a little embarrassing whist it goes through its 10 second space ship impression again to re initialise!

On enquiry to answer the question regarding the steps taken by Allied to 'properly engineer' a vehicle destined for the road, Andy Robertson of Allied made a convincing imitation of a disreputable cowboy running away from his responsibilities.

Their current strap-line is 'driving for perfection' which is hilarious in context. After receiving public funding to develop the vehicles, Allied wanted to suck up even more public money by suing Glasgow City Council after they rejected the vehicles as being unfit and unsafe. Not satisfied with that, they saw a further opportunity to dispose of the liabilities they had created while still sucking more money by selling them in open auctions.

The shame of it was that the vehicles generally worked and a fairly small amount of further engineering effort, together with a viable supply of spares, could have yielded useful vehicles. The problem was that they used prototype parts as if they were suitable for serial production.

I am still tempted to challenge them in the small claims court, but, despite my significant loss because of their antics, there are some things, and some people, you just can't be bothered to waste your life on even if it might mean recovering some cash.

I'm just naming them here so that if anyone happens by this thread then they should be aware that certainly in my case, and those of others with like stories, Allied of Glasgow have not stood behind their products and have sold on vehicles with components never intended for public sale, despite advertising them for public sale in their sales literature. They have said they would and could support the vehicle, and then flatly dropped it like a hot potato when help has been requested.

@EPNR I only really noticed a reduction after 45k miles coming into this winter. The most noticable change is that the voltage drop is more significant when the amps rise. If I cross 100A now at any percentage the volts with drop sub 245V. My mileage per percent has remained pretty much unchanged however I cannot drop below 35% anymore as my voltage on high amps drops below 238V. I live in a very hilly area and this could definitely have had an effect on the stamina of the cells, it is 2% down to the local village and 11% home!!

Our main technical contact at allied openly admitted this and wasn't even at the company when the vehicles were developed, despite being made the main support point of contact. We struggled to get documentation let alone spares.

We actually got quite far into discussions around purchasing the remaining spares, setting up a formal support agreement etc but the cost of doing so was silly (well into 5 figures) not viable for around 100 vehicles on the off chance they may come to us. Again, an example of allied washing their hands of the vehicles where they were given an opportunity to allow support of their own vehicles through a third party.

We have worked on more than 20. Only around 100 were made. In my professional opinion they are not fit for purpose. Our advice for about 18 months now has been to stay away and buy a Nissan ENV200 (in the case of partner and bipper).

EDIT: Worth adding that the only way to support these now is to use other vehicles as donors. We have two partners in our allied scrap yard at the moment which have kept another 5 on the road.

There's me and my big mouth! Now I have problems!

Went on holiday for 15 days and left the epartner off charge with 12v disconnected with SOC at about 85%. Came back and reconnected 12v and left it on timer for an overnight E7 charge then did short trips for a couple of days, then went a but further about 35 miles and it started to cut out at SOC 56% Luckily I was close to home so I limped home with multiple restarts and finally had to run a lead out to it to charge for 10 mins to get it back on the drive. Previously I had only seen this behaviour at SOC 20% (only the once) and it had been quite reliable running home on SOC in the low 20%'s.

So we got a balance this time but I am guessing that the ‚ÄúBlnc‚Äù table with a ‚Äú0‚Äù in the 5th cell of slave 5 means that cell 53 did not balance and cell 53 is still the lowest.

Ever hopeful I took it out in a longer run and got almost 40 miles before it ‚Äúran out‚Äù again at exactly 56% again, it would seem that this is my new SOC lower limit with a shortened range!?

Can anyone explain what is happening and suggest what if anything I can do?

I do hope this is not a 3rd one for the scrap yard!?

So No 36 seems to be behaving now but 53 is still the lowest. It is difficult to understand how 4hundreths of a volt between 53 and the next lowest 76 at 3.350v can make all that difference but I suppose it is the voltages at the failure point that causes the issue.

Is it of any interest that we are getting a low cell volts warning but not a critical error [2] or a Low Low cell volts warning [18]. Might it be worth checking these settings and considering a small tweak to the low cell warning setting.

If it is cutting out you would think that there would be more than a first level warning listed?

Name: Unnamed: 0, dtype: int64",1439,"May 6, 2018","I am looking at the change of voltage on 36. Yes, it is up at the right voltage fully charged, but it does not seem to support it when discharged. That suggests a lowered capacity.

Meanwhile the other cell does seem to hold the difference, so it has lost charge but probably has the capacity.

I think the general conclusion from my experiences is that cells can, ultimately, develop a bigger leakage current than the (very weak and primitive) BMS can deal with. In this case, it has been exaggerated because you've been away.

I would be thinking to replace 36 and manually rebalance 53 while the pack is open.",0,None

The BMS is clearly poorly conceived if it can do that, and although the mechanical and electrical build quality is good there were several aspects that looked just dead wrong, without even knowing anything about the electronics and software in it.

Does anyone have a manual or info for the Ansaldo motor drive by any chance?

Why do you need it?

The Ansaldo parts are pretty bullet proof.

The weak point of the whole crooked setup is the crap central ECU that is a custom part and is irreplaceable.I worried about this from the outset and it was indeed the doom of the thing.

Allied Vehicles are crooks. They said that they could support and service this thing when I bought it and when I bought on this basis they dropped it dead in the water. It was a product built from prototype parts and sold as a viable vehicle. I do not have the capacity or mindset to sue for the ¬£5000 or so they effectively ripped me off by. I was a mug for believing they had built anything more than a mobile shed with batteries, because I had a chance to reject via credit card's several liability and passed it up because there was simply nothing else we could move to at that point in time.

I could not have made a bigger mistake believing people were going to help me keep it on the road. I believed what they said and told me. I feel like an idiot for believing anyone anymore (and you wonder why I am the way I am!?).

I had considered putting in place a completely new inverter run by a new controller, with a separate BMS also custom. Too much stuff was happening at the time, and still is.",0,2350906

Well that's why - I was thinking about putting in a simple replacement brain to do the bare minimum needed to charge and drive, as I have done for other conversions in the past. 

As you say the inverter and motor themselves seem usable and probably reliable enough.

For that I want to check what is needed to enable the drive. I've now got a schematic of the MicroVett Fiat which had the same drive, and it has enough clues to give it a try, so I probably will.

But again if anyone has technical info or a wiring diagram or anything it would help things along.

Yup, agreed that Allied should not have been selling these, they just weren't fit for purpose - sorry you got burned. So did the chap I got this one from.",1,0

I used LV, explained fully what the car was, (Allied Partner), and they accepted it. It said on the schedule it was an LPG conversion which I queried many times, (they said that's the nearest description they could put on the schedule).
I was a little concerned but asked each time that it was recorded in their notes, also when looking up the reg. number on insurance web pages it clearly states it is an Allied electric. The price was good. I think I tried AdrianFlux who would insure it, but more expensive. CarolNash might also, you could try one against the other if no joy from LV.

I bought the vehicle without viewing from I believe a reputable trader, and its now arrived on a trailer.
After 5 yards it conked out even though the battery charge state was showing 72%, owning a couple of Edison Ford Transits, I immediately assumed the low voltage circuit, I had been told it was fitted with a new battery, but just in case I put it on charge, only took a few amps it was fine, just managed to make it roll to my 3phase supply and hooked it up. Seemed to charge up to 100% in approx. 3 hours? but it was still taking 20 amps when I switched it off, where as at 90% on my Transit it has generally gone on to one charger it has (4off,) and goes on and off for an hour for the last 10/15%. Whilst this was going on, I attempted to read the data stream from the OBD plug, but my transfer software is for CNC machine tools, and although it streams its garbage, so ive now ordered more software. Checking the vehicle over, i couldn't help noticing how clean and well oiled the main battery pack mounting bolts were. I contacted the sellers with my misgivings and observations, and they now inform me, that the battery pack has indeed been removed and several cells replaced, and I have been assured, once I charge and discharge it a few times the BMS will sort it all out.
Once charged the vehicle seemed to drive fine and I completed 3 miles flat out in short bursts up and down a private road, as I am reluctant to swap over my insurance at this time from my Transit, as it will probably be going back. I will wait till I can get the battery pack info before I make any decisions, but I doubt that a few cycles will sort this out. Because its such a narrow band of enthusiasts that get involved in such undertakings, has anybody else seen this vehicle, and can shed any light, and let me know their findings. Because of my ignorance in electronics I actually went and bought a damaged Nissan E - NV200 van to take the Transits place, but apart from a mountain of work, after buying the thing, I found out you can't fit a towbar, to these things, and I had hoped to be sprinting an electric motorcycle this year, and at 9ft plus it wont fit inside the ENV hence I bought the Peugeot. Why don't I just keep the transit, its a fridge van with tons of insulation and fibreglass, and I need to remove the bulkhead to get the bike inside, and although I have recorded 76 miles from her in summer, its only a 36kw pack, and the Peugeot is 55kw and I can also stand up inside, seemed an obvious choice????????????.

Ah, big mistake. My wife unplugged hers several times at 100% on the GOM and if came to a stop about 10 miles down the road. It was freezing cold, so initially thought it was the weather until I found out what she was doing. I built a power supply box that measured the current draw when charging then when the consumption dropped to less than 3A (single phase charging) it shut down the connection. Never had an issue after that.

The BMS is exceptionally slow to balance, it will never properly balance on its own if a cell is out by, say, 10%. The reading from the data connection will tell you all.

You can see what the cell voltages are and its not really charged until they get past 3.6v If you start and do a short recording and stop on Hyper terminal, you can get a decent chunk of data out. That can then be looked at in Excel and cleaned up, you can then see what the cells are doing. 
I have been warned by a chap at Allied some while ago, not to have the mains in and a laptop operating on mains. He had a problem with doing that. I use small netbooks for this.
You can do a run out and set hyperterminal to start record, and then stop when you get back. I do about10 mile runs to keep the file size down and manageable. If it cuts out then you will have a record of that. After its cut back stop the recording. Saves time searching for the segment of data.

I ran the vehicle again this morning maybe woke it up, either way it does not seem as bad as I thought, I had only completed approx. 5 miles in the vehicle and went from 100% down to 90% but the cell voltage under load went down I think to 236v which I thought was low, and I didnt want to go further until I had battery info, either way I will now await your expert opinions based on the battery pack the rest I can sort I hope, will keep you all posted, but I will also post exactly how I did it, as I think their was one bit you had to do in a certain way ????, will confirm after a few more trials. yours Dave",0,None

This will not sort itself out as this bms works by bleeding the high cells. All it can do is bleed all of the other cells down individually until they reach the same voltage which would take an age. Issue you have is a low cell which is limiting the rest of the pack.

If it is simply out of balance rather than has a fault (e.g. internal short) then it could be bought back up manually but this is a very complex process and needs specialist equipment and a way of dropping the battery.

Allied have basically said to me 'see you in court'. It has been an extremely disreputable chapter in their history and Allied Vehicles of Glasgow cannot be trusted, they are not an honourable company.

Name: Unnamed: 0, dtype: int64",1439,"Jan 21, 2019","You have to run the charge until it stops. This was the painful lesson I learned when I first killed mine.

What it does is really simple, so simple it is utterly stupid. It will keep charging until one of the cells hits a certain voltage. It then resets the 'SOC' to 100%. It then deducts a certain % for each Coulomb of charge out, and then counts % back in for Coulombs in. Because it counts less Coulombs out than in it slowly drops the SOC. It is at 90% when it first reaches and reads 100%, that's why it keeps on charging.

So if you never charge fully to 100% and let it stop then it'll slowly drop and you might have, say, 50% showing but SOC is zero. I was charging to 95% for several charges and did not know this. I went off on a trip, and it hit zero real charge whilst displaying 37%.

This was a painful and very expensive 'first' failure of mine. It is hard won information that is in this forum if you read the detail.

It was a prototype, remember. Just a prototype. Was never meant to be relied on by consumers. You have to run the charge until it fully stops itself.

as you can see not a pretty picture, this is what I usually call toast, only did 1/2 mile in fits and starts, so its a good job I didn't carry on, but looking at the above a lot more cells will be flagging up if I could have taken it for a proper run, and it is obviously unfit for use. First if I decide to keep it, can I get replacement cells, and roughly how much per cell. Second I recently had a damaged env200 van with a 24kw pack in the shop as well as a 2017 damaged leaf with a 30kw pack, could anybody help with interfacing either one or two packs, or a later 40kw pack I am more than comfortable fitting this onto the van but not the electronics side and it may be with all the leafs about ect, some clever chappi has already got round all the bms issues, I am aware its not as simple as said, even the pack voltage is different, so its custom made packs with all its attendant legislation, I would even consider buying another leaf and transferring the running gear into it, but the spaghetti really puts me off. So if anybody has got a scrap boxer, or a large pack of good cells, let me know.

If the 97% SOC is a true indication of you having only just disconnected and ran a few miles, then I think that is a sorry set of cells, especially the gaggle of very low cells of course. I don't recall seeing less than 3.0V under load until I was below 70% or so, and I had a couple of imbalanced cells at that.

My memory might be failing me here, but my impression would be a pack that has deteriorated through age.

Others may know better than me, is this a different chemistry? I can't see why these voltages would be so low for LFP?

The other possibility is that your top charge voltage has been wrongly set low. They are fairly well in balance. If someone has set the charge cut-off voltage too low this might also be a possible reason for what you are seeing.",0,None

You should be able to drive at least 50 miles in the Boxer, even in the current cold weather and probably a lot more. Lack of power steering suggests lack of 12v so either a well under capacity 12v battery or poor DC to DC. Some of the Boxers had two DC to DC units to give adequate 12v power. The 12v is only charged when you have the vehicle turned on. It only has a very small mains (1 and 3phase) 12v power supply that operates when charging , enough to power the 12v systems and no more (and often not even that).",0,2509294

My experience is that bottom balancing really doesnt work. You must have a BMS and a BMS normally has some balancing system, this is always top balanced. If you bottom balance then you will always have the pack limited. Charging is the main issue with managing a usable pack. And its at the top end of the charge that you tend over time to get variance. You also dont want to discharge a pack anywhere near to the point at which you would bottom balance, so the pack starts off actually being unbalanced. This is not the case with brandnew perfect cells. Cells perform very differently under load, and as such a bottom balance is only balanced at a no load situation, put those cells under load and they will diverge hugely. Some disastrously . If you top balance to a reasonable voltage (I take these 210ah cells in the Boxer to 3.65v max) you dont push them to the point at which the largely diverge, but you do get the pack as fully charged as possible. Having as high a voltage in the pack as you can means that current will be at its lowest, if they are not all as charged as possible (always happens with bottom balance as you wont be able to charge to as high a voltage) some will be at a greater stress and will exhibit a higher voltage drop under load.",0,None

Name: Unnamed: 0, dtype: int64",39505,"Mar 12, 2019","Hi Everybody. First off thanks Grumpy for the info re motor driver combination I totally agree, but what I had meant to say was I would also be using my 11"" dia FLT DC motor combined with my Kelly 144V DC controller that I already have, not the AC motor currently in the car. That said I have now just bought a new Sevcon water cooled 300V x 300Amp controller to I hope save swopping the motor out ect, and also approx. 50% to 60% of the issues regards Allied vehicles in general, and the rest I hope to resolve with a later BMS which I think is actually the weakest link, and causes more potential issues than the rest, (once you have nailed the 12v system) but I am going to need a lot of help on the electronics side, and if anybody has any wiring diagrams ect, for any part of the system it would be a big help. The vehicle has not turned a wheel since, and is still at 92% charge although the cells are now a lot closer matched, once the load has been removed, I am reluctant to now charge again to 100% and then store in this state, as I said before I only have a short strip of land to trial/discharge, and wanted to leave at 60 to 70% for long term storage I did try to lower the main pack via ignition on lights on hazards on ect, as the draw for the 12v system is also taken eventually from the main pack, but after 5/6 hours not 1% change, which I thought was odd, but it at least iconfirmed the DC TO DC system is fine. I did consider jacking up one side, and running/discharging that way, but not ideal, and unloaded it would be using probably only minimal amps anyway, anybody any better ideas, or just keep the lights on for a week. I think the pack will probably need to be tweaked manually, so it may be easier to remove first as last. I can see roughly how its done, but has anybody tried it WITHOUT A RAMP if so ime all ears. Ive now got an NV200 so can work on Boxer properly, and not rush. And finally now ive spent so much already, another Boxer for spares would be ideal.

Normal operation.
When driving the DC to DC is powered by the main pack and is brought on line once the pack is live, ie ign turned and the vehicle has powered up.
The 12v battery is heavily used and often struggles to deliver the required load in normal conditions. The worst load being the hydraulic power steering.
When charging the vehicle, the main pack is charged, but the 12v is barely touched having just a small 12v power supply to make sure there is enough 12v supply to run the main battery pack systems. Its less than 5 amps and is often set not much above 12v. It wont charge a low level of charge 12v battery.
This means if the vehicle is then left unplugged the 12v will continue to be used by the Vehicle systems, (Radio central locking etc) as well as the BMS etc. This meanss the 12v will get flat over a few days if not used.
I have suggested to people that they use a separate 12v charger to ensure the 12v is charged when the vehicle is charged.
On an expert I am working on I have installed a system (Used it on other EVs before) that monitors the 12v battery and when it hits 12.2 v (Ideal for least sulphation, so Im told) for 20 seconds (allows central locking to dip the voltage and recover) it turns on the main system, and therefore the DC to DC for two hours. It is disabled by cycling the Ignswitch before using the vehicle. It does need some extra control added to turn off the hydraulic power steering pump which is currently running with no load, not a big deal but wasting power and an annoying noise.
A good condition and adequately sized 12v battery is vital to these vehicles. You probably have a problem with the 12v battery . Keep the meter on the 12v through the turn on cycle and see how it drops . It may be going just too low when initially loaded.
12v supply is really important to these vehicles, and the simple addition of an extra 12v charger does make a difference.
Also check the voltage of the 12v when the systems are up and running, often this is not really set high enough and is loafing just over 13v, ie not really charging , which will drop heavily when using the steering and lights etc.Do check the 12v battery voltage, and see what its doing.

Well my little old tepee made it to 50k!! Glad the temperature is starting to rise again. No fun driving this car at low temps, the cells have no stamina and the voltage drops fast when I exceed 100 amps. Strangely I still get roughly the same distance per percentage used but I don't go below 35% as cell voltage starts to drop dangerously low uphills. Still sufficient for my everyday commute so will be interesting to see how much more mileage is in the pack. Haven't got a chance to plug in a laptop and check readings in a while but will do so soon now that outside temperatures seems to be a bit higher. Out of interest has anyone put up much higher mileage than this on any of the Allied vehicles?

Hello there falcon.

We are new here,and also have a Peugeot partner tepee full electric vehicle converted by allied electric
And it has done 57,964 miles.
We have the first drivers quick start guide from allied electric,and in that it gives information on how to charge the car if it has been standing for a while,and gives advice on how to balance the batteries, by running the car 5 miles, then recharge fully,then drive 10 miles, then recharge fully
Then 15 miles then recharge fully
Then 20 miles then recharge fully
And so on.
We have done that and seem to be ok with the battery.
Had a hiccup with the 12v system,but sorted out now.
It was a corroded wire.
Just want to know more about the vehicle, and if anyone has charged on 3 phase,and if so what comes up on the screen while it's charging?

If you troll back through this section I bought a Allied Boxer van several months ago, despite everybodys reservations. It is only now I have been able to take a look at her, and the first thing I did was charge her up again. When fully charged, the amps went down to zero, and the small screen just says in charge, should it say charge complete, and then disconnect automatically? I then disconnected the 3phase plug, and switched off at the ign switch, but what actually happened is when I do switch of completely at the key, and I can even remove the key, it still shows in charge. In desperation, i eventually decided to disconnect the neg lead from the 12v auxiliary battery, and still the same, it was only when the red pos 12v lead was also disconnected did it actually switch off. I then reconnected the 12v system, and the van was live again with the key out, ie showing on the green panel 100% 1a and red stop light, I fitted the key and then fully turned on to pos 2 and clunk, relays, and red light turns to green, and I am able to drive normally. I then switched off completely again as before, but can still drive, so I then removed both wiring plugs that fit into the bottom of the ignition barrel, to eliminate a short from this, but still able to drive. Finally disconnected the 12v neg lead still the same, and then the pos lead also, and this time it still runs. Each time I check the aux 12v supply it is recording 13 + volts even now with no battery connected, I think the main pack contactor must still be enabled, and also the 280v to 12v dc to dc convertor is still pulled in / live, and think I can hear a hum from the fan so assume this is why she is still sat their ready to go. First can anybody tell me, can I remove a fuse from the fuse box located under the bonnet on the nearside, which energises the main contactor /relay, and which one? I was just going to pull them all but worried I may put a spike into something else, and cause further mayhem, or can I just hit with finesse the appropriate spot and start again. Any info where the actual contactors are located, would be helpful, the vehicle has completed less than 4000 miles in total, so doubtful they are worn out, just stiff from so little use.

Name: Unnamed: 0, dtype: int64",39505,"Oct 10, 2019","Hi A quick update, I thought I could turn van off whilst the aux battery was disconnected, and charger not connected, by simply putting all the lights on, and putting power steering onto full lock, to overwhelm the dc to dc converter, it worked a treat, unfortunately after a short reset it sat up ready, round 2. I then drove the vehicle with the 12v disconnected, as fast as I could, over a small pothole, where is a large one when you need it, hoping to shock/jar it open, I even took the liberty to feather the throttle just as passing over, so any arc would be minimal, anyway that was also an abject failure, would have been really chuffed if it had worked, but at least back at the yard, now disconnecting the 12v drops the dc to dc out, so at least its not charging /running 24/7, and apart from the 280v contactor stuck closed, its a bit better than before. Looks like I will have to drop the pack soon, and ive got to do it outside, and I have no ramp, but I do have 4 small trolley jacks and scaffold poles to roll it onto, not ideal, but needs really must. The battery pack is held in place on several brackets, one end is via a 24mm vertical stud, which will give a bit of compliance when lowering down, and also 2 off 19mm bolts passing through the battery box. I can see advantages both ways, but if I undo the two 19mm bolts directly in the battery case, is the nut captive, as I don't want it rolling round inside. My second question is how many leads do I need to disconnect, and where are they located, I assume a heavy duty pos and neg lead and BMS I hope the 280v leads are female? shrouded, as they will be live, and if I get it wrong, this may be my last post I do, but I have been on some big jobs in the past, and I am sure it will put me in good stead, and despite it not being ideal conditions, will just take my time, and at any time I am not comfortable just stop. That said any pointers would be very welcome, and I hope to take a few pics to show inside the pack to help others. Thanks in advance yours Dave",0,None

In your first post where you mentioned when you had charged her up for the first time, I'm sure you said you disconnected the 3 phase cable and (switched off at the ign switch, and can even remove the key and the car is still on and running)
You don't have the key in the ignition Dave when the car is on charge, 
""Thus is it I have read it correctly"" what you said.
You just plug into the car your cable and then the other end to the 3 phase supply, then turn on the 3 phase supply.
The screen should read in charge, and -19 or -20 amps and the current voltage in top right or screen, which changes as it's charging.
When it's 100% it will still say in charge still.until the cable is unplugged, reverse of connection procedure.
At no point in the charging must the key be in the ignition.
It's very sensitive,ours is,even when we are a couple of inches away from the ignition barrel, the screen lights up for a second or 2 and displays allied electric vehicle's glasgo.
And there's a clunk.
And that's with the key inches away from the barrel.
And as soon as we put the key into the ignition, there's a clunk again.

Leaf is basically plug and play too now too and is better setup for front wheel drive to replace an engine - tesla units often need more difficult mounting / suspension changes.

As it sucks a lot of power as well as being noisey.
Just got a new cable for charging via the public charge points, so we will be testing that out shortly.

I would say that regarding waking it up, you need to either -
Charge the auxiliary battery.
Or pop a new one in, before you do anything.
Then if you got a cable that's yellow and has a 3 pin normal plug on the end. Use that to slowly trickle charge it up ( if your not easy or confident dropping and opening the battery box)
Otherwise ask grumpy b or Donald regarding charging the cells individually.
Hope all goes well whichever way you choose to do it.

The vehicle was just to high to fit in the shop, so I had to drop the pack in the yard, now its off, ive rolled it into the shop on a pallet truck and 5"" dia tubes, not ideal, I don't know about a 2 post lift, I would have been a lot happier on a good level hardstanding. What did trip me up though, was the big hump at the front of the pack, the high voltage switch gear ect. I assumed the pack was the same height all along, and it was only after lowering onto tubes, and also removing the 1 ton of breeze blocks I had fitted earlier to compress the suspension, and lower the height that I had placed inside earlier, before I could see the hump, and jacking up the van later as an after thought made it even worse, hence the couple of pics I have posted if anybody else is considering doing the same. Now ive done it like this, I intend to just use my 16mm stud clamping kit from my milling machine, using progressively longer studs to lower, and far more important to use in reverse, which will keep everything in alignment naturally when bringing back up, time consuming, but I don't fancy lumbering those breeze blocks back in and out either.

Also when I rebuild I would like to charge the pack at full voltage before it goes back, and hope to use the vans 240v Zivan to do so, is it possible to get the charger to charge the pack direct, whilst not communicating with it, ie by using a jumper wire and or a resistor? or flicking a dill switch, anything to fool it into thinking its canbus is connected. I realise I will have to monitor the pack very very very closely when doing so, as it will just keep pumping away until it destroys the pack. At the moment ime charging the pack up in 48v lumps, for 4 hours each, and although they settle very well, ime sure the pack will be all over the place, when reconnected, and being able to drip feed several small charges at full voltage I can settle the pack, and hopefully weed out any issues before it all goes back in.

Hello just wondering if there's anyone there haha, as I posted the above messages. A fortnight ago
Thanks in advance.
Also wanted to ask, has anyone replaced the charger in their Peugeot partner tepee?
We would like to replace ours, and wanted to know what a good replacement would be?
Thank you very much indeed kindest regards to you all.

Yes, I've done a lot to mine (expert) since I last posted on here. If you use an arduino or similar to read the CAN from the battery then you can put in any charger you like, e.g second hand brusa, or one of the modern alternatives like TC, ovar. The old EDN chargers seem to have a weakness in the input filter/protection circuit, and blow up very easily when you get power spikes
I've got plenty of spares and info if you're in need of anything as I've ripped out all the axeon rubbish from mine and put in a system that actually balances the cells",0,2741627

Hi Grumpy thanks for the update, as you pointed out it needs to be done properly, which was why I was requesting info to trick the charger, to replicate as closely as possible a normal charge regime , rather than in 48v blocks, plus it would speed things up. That said ive now found a few more cells are low, and as my current van is still able to do 30 miles a charge, I have now decided to leave it as it is for the moment, and look at other options for the spare vehicle. Looking inside the very well constructed battery tray, I am out of my comfort zone with regards all the wiring, if it was regarded as good, and reliable, I would just fit more cells, and box it back up, but as we know it is very unreliable, which is why after 10 years, the vehicle has not gone 2000 miles from the date it was built. I already have a very large dc motor and a couple of controllers, and a nearly complete battery pack, a virtually brand new rolling chassis, and a lot of enthusiasm. I know its not the way to go, but for me its a lot easier to understand, and that means at least I might be able to keep it on the road. Hi Marc I, and I am sure others would be very interested in your Arduino interface, I always thought said if you could still read the battery data stream, but then ignore it and all the spurious faults, ie completely bypass the existing battery management everything? and then use an Arduino to then tell the controller what it needs to see to run, would make the vehicle 75% better from as i see now 10%. For me provided you never dropped say below 250v, and after several runs gauged your mileage. Fully charge each time, and clock the KW, it would give sufficient data to enable us to monitor the battery health, and just plug in the laptop as required to see how many times you would have stopped. As soon as I can, I will drop my big DC motor in and give it a spin with half a pack just sat in the back. at least then I will know if its worthwhile doing. All the best for Christmas everybody and beyond. yours Dave Arthur",0,2751897

Hi there marc, no I don't have the software for the inverter, our car is the partner tepee, and so our motor is 15kw nominal and 30kw peak,
So the inverter can be tweeted? That's interesting, the other thing why I was asking about another motor, is there is a rumbling once we hit 40mph, which I have gleened from here, that this is to do with the motor mountings, in that it is not aligned properly, any ideas Marc? Haha 
When you say your guessing we would be after a single phase charger, we're a bit nieve here, as you know currently it can charge single or 3 phase.
But we can't use the very extensive range of 7kw charge points up and down the UK.
As it will only charge at the same speed it does at home when it's plugged in, using the single phase cable.
And on the other end of the scale it charges at 7kw on 3 phase at the 22kw and the 43kw charge points, via the 3 phase cable, and never the 2 shall meet, meaning we can't use the single phase cable on 3 phase points and the 3 phase cable on single phase points. As the charger knows what cable is plugged in, and charges as it sees fit, hahaha.
The other thing at the moment, while we are on parts, is the springs, they are rubbish, can we use expert springs and shocks on the partner tepee??
Thanks very much indeed Marc ,sorry to bombard you with all this, we would be very much appreciate any and or all advice if possible.

Hi Marc any chance of posting that code, etc and any pics of the setup, exactly just as you did it, as for me, it will really help, I can usually follow a set of instructions, but the electronics part of any project, fills me with trepidation instead of excitement, and I don't normally delve this deep, but understand enough to realise, it is so easy to make it so much worse very quickly, and then far more expensive to repair than before I started. Can you also just confirm, its a Teensyduino 3.6 to order, ( I thought you were just referring / saying a small electronics component, and not that this was the actual product name ) and do I need anything else, so I can order now, and hopefully have something I can play with over Christmas.

The Partner does not have any issues that stop me using it but there are a few glitches with the EV system and the Peugeot electrics. It's only being used for short journeys (~ 100 miles per week) atm with the odd 25-40 mile trip thrown in.

I have a Peugeot boxer and a. Expert from Allied. The Boxer was fully working until few weeks ago (16000miles) until decided to stop.
I think the problem come from one of the 3phase who doesn't supply enough energy (I guess would be due to a failure one of the capacitor in the motor controller box).

A meccanich took the gear box away and we get the motor to spin as normal once the shaft is ""helped"" manually to kick start. After that goes ok.

As a first thing I'd check the wiring for the encoder/temperature sensor for damage/corrosion, it's pretty exposed down there, and it's good to rule out the easy stuff first. beyond that there are some diagnostic fault flags in the messages from the motor controller, which may help you figure out where the fault lies, and also a old program to connect with a serial port, do you have a copy?",0,2770369

Hi Marcb,
RE; Motor controller fault flags. 
Are these retrieved by using the software (Caneopix) via the 9pin RS232 serial connector in the passenger footwell (Partner Tepee) or is it through the TTL serial RX/TX mentioned in Ansaldo drive manual? You mentioned before about tweaking the inverter parameters but I was not sure if it was the existing RS232 interface you were using. 
As you can see I am not yet up to speed on where everything is on the vehicle.
Is it normal for the power steering/vacuum pump to start running when the ignition key is on position 1 ? This is what mine does. I read the Allied handbook and it seems the pumps should start to run after turning the key to position 2 when the main contactor is initialised. This makes sense to me, at the moment the ignition cannot be on without the pumps running. I do not know what is typical as I have not seen another Allied vehicle.

the motor contoller fault flags are in the can messages on the ""Vcan"" ( motor controller. dash display, blue ecu of doom) they are described in the ansaldo manual you mention.

Hi Marcb,
Thanks for the info, I will have a look at the inverter connector and add the wires if necessary, I believe both CAN networks are available in the underbonnet box in the same manner as the Expert..
The pics attached show that Partner box is a different construction from the previous photos in this thread, no DIN rail in sight, almost all Molex minifit.
In this box, fitted on the PCB there are ~ 5 relays for various functions and a couple of blade fuses, there are LEDs for the KeyOn and KeyStart positions as well as others. In my car I cannot have the ignition on at any position without the pumps running and this is a problem, it may be there is something 'stuck'.

Regards

Hi Marcb,
Thanks for checking, I'll have to locate the pump relays(?) and put a toggle switch in as I have to take a 1 hour trip on a ferry once or twice a week and this means it prevents me having the Ign Sw (KeyOn) in the first position at any time whilst waiting without draining the battery unnecessarily.
Interestingly inside the underbonnet box is a sticker with a part number which indicates it is made by SCE, the same people who made the Dash display and the Supervisor (blue) ECU.
I have already removed the microswitches from the gear lever in preparation for re-enabling the gear selection by the OEM cables. I have used a 3 position locking lever switch to replace the m/switches and it works OK. This cable replacement is necessary as I live up a very steep hill with a single track road, the Partner can only manage 5-7MPH as it nears the top but always makes it - just. I cannot take a run at the hill (junction at bottom) but the interesting thing is, that if it is driven for 15-20 miles prior to approaching the hill the Partner will achieve 12-15 MPH up the hill, normally it is ~ 5 miles drive from 'cold' . This happens regardless of the traction battery charge state.
Something is 'warming up' perhaps, I need to get more info from the controllers.

Hi Hugh Sounds a fair assessment, and it would still bring the budget under 10K half the price of my current ENV 200 Van, and unlike the transit, because its front wheel drive it sits lower on the road than a rear wheel drive equivalent, so hopefully more aerodynamic, and its already fitted with a diesel heater, which does not deplete the main battery pack, so more frugal.

@Don Andrew h If you've got a rumbling from the motor/gearbox at certain speeds it could be misalignment yes, the spare 60kw motor I've got has fairly substantial wear on the motor shaft splines/adapter so I'd be concerned thats what you're hearing, or possibly the early stages. I'm not sure about springs, being interchangable, have you looked for aftermarket/ heavy duty ones?
the connector used on the battery limits you to about 7kw (about 20 amps battery side) which kind of guides the decision on chargers. I've certainly managed to tweak the settings on my 60kw motor, first thing I'd check is how much power your vehicle is using in reality when you're flat out up hill, (voltsxamps from the dash)

Click to expand...

Hello there Marc b.
Thanks for the information, I don't have any knowledge of computers and codes etc
We tried it flat out up a couple of hills and the most we have had on the dash is 157amps
(The middle figure) couldn't look at the voltage at the RHS at same time for safety! Haha
Do you need the voltage reading as well??
It would be great to have more power, it's very slow on the setting off, and however much you press the Pedro, it just gradually goes faster at its own pace!! Haha
Yes the rumble is more like a bearing going kind of noise, but only is present 40mph and above.below and it's quite and smooth and just has the little whine if the motor uphill, and when breaking.
A different charger would be great, we could use the 7kw ones then that are everywhere, we can use the 22kw and 40kw ones now with a 3 phase cable tho. So that's not as important as the motor at the moment

Click to expand...

157 amps, that's luxury! assuming your pack is about 250 volts at that point, thats the best part of 40kW from the battery, assuming the motor is at peak power (30kW) thats about 75% efficiency which is plausible for an induction motor running at it's 2 minute rating. 
My expert, which I beleive had ""factory"" settings, would start off like a racer, then fade away into an awful flat spot above 25mph (approx peak torque, mines in second gear) so at 30mph flat out up hill It would show 130-140A followed by finding a second wind once above 40mph and pull about 200 amps by 50mph (bear in mind the expert is supposed to be 60kw not 30, and is a bigger heavier van...)
joking aside, if you could read the settings out of the ansaldo inverter I'd be very interested to see them. On a cold motor (they never conneted the temp sensor) my expert was savage off the line, to the point it can triger the inverter to shutdown. so it sounds like your van is setup for the opposite initial torque/acceleration.

you'll need the caneponix software, a 32bit loptop, (windows xp or older) and will probably need to wire in a dsub9 connector to the ansaldo inverter, if you open up the signals connector at the inverter you can solder in the wires for the serial cable (rs232 dsub9), here's a photo of the connector, and an example wiring diagram for a similar vehicle, the ""inverter diagnostic port"" wiring is drawn in yellow here, so it's a lot easier to trace than the allied diagrams

Unless it is a drop in replacement, mechanically and electrically speaking, it could be a lot of work, especially getting the motor controller (inverter) and van to talk to each other. Also the cells in these vehicles in terms are pretty well matched to the motor in terms of power (2-3C discharge if your are still healthy), and now ~10years old, as well as the axeon BMS being a fruit machine at the best of times. I'd say significant power increase would call for a new battery too. I think it's potentially a very expensive thing to do, and may leave you with a kit of bits.
Physically putting the motor under the bonnet is the easy bit, then you'd need to reverse engineer the ECU - inverter CAN messages wiring etc, and find a way of integrating the new and old components.

Hi, sorry I'd not been on here for a while, by drop in replacement, I meant something that could mount to the same gearbox/driveshafts, and would have the same input voltage from the batteries, as well as being . The Leaf is a higher voltage system, so the inverter(motor controller) would probably not even turn on. Also getting it to ""talk"" to the van would be hard. In engineering terms it's like a Japanese businessman trying to talk to an Italian farmers, different speeds, different words.

Unless it is a drop in replacement, mechanically and electrically speaking, it could be a lot of work, especially getting the motor controller (inverter) and van to talk to each other. Also the cells in these vehicles in terms are pretty well matched to the motor in terms of power (2-3C discharge if your are still healthy), and now ~10years old, as well as the axeon BMS being a fruit machine at the best of times. I'd say significant power increase would call for a new battery too. I think it's potentially a very expensive thing to do, and may leave you with a kit of bits.
Physically putting the motor under the bonnet is the easy bit, then you'd need to reverse engineer the ECU - inverter CAN messages wiring etc, and find a way of integrating the new and old components. The CAN format for the blue ECU under the bonnet is one of the major bits of info I can't get my hands on  the Italian manufacturer will not support them, maybe someone on this forum has info?

Hello there hope you are keeping well and safe.
We are wanting to know if we get a new motor like a hyper 9, it co.es with a controller, so that should be a straight forward fit shouldn't it?
Would I need to get the battery cells checked, and any Dodgy cells replaced??
If so, where would I get these from cheap??
Or any battery cheap.
And motor for that matter, seems they are all in America!

Many many thanks indeed

I've said this so many times.

Just buy an env200 or kangoo ze, sell the parts from this off on the conversion market and for static energy storage.

There's a reason these were sold off cheaply....

Thanks for the advice.
If I were to use parts in another vehicle, then we have another possible donar car, 
It would mean converting that car to electric.
Is that straight forward (legal wise) as I'm not heavily modifying it.

Just changing the fuel, from petrol to electric.

Hello there.

Thank you for your reply, tho it wasn't the reply I was intending hearing, hahaha.
Can I ask, Why do you say these are of little value?
It's a nice big spacious vehicle, and it's electric.
I get the fact that the technology put into them wasn't cutting edge or anything.
But as a vehicle goes, it's got size and space on its side if nothing else.
And compare it with a leaf, size wise it beats it, yet it does nearly the same range (2011 leaf)(2011 Peugeot partner tepee) 
Yes it's not got the fancy dashboard and rapid charging.
But for its time, Whalen it was converted, it's roughly the same as the leaf, stats wise, 
And the bodywork is in good order,
Sliding doors
Massive hatchback
Nice ride height
Plenty of space for batteries and components
Why are people so negative about this vehicle.
Surely with the current bad bits taken out
Or even everything taken out and just put repurposed/refurbished parts in, 
It would be a good vehicle???

Same batteries, different BMS
Different motor and controller
Different charger
Something along the lines of what they do in vintage voltage??
It looks simple
And everything plugs in and talks to each other.
There's none of this complicated business.
Just my thoughts, but I would welcome your (positive) thoughts hahaha
Many thanks indeed

Ultimately, and sorry to be critical but we looked after more than a fifth of these vans (over 20 at one point)... What you have is a 2010/2011 Peugeot van with unreliable running gear. A good petrol version is worth what, ¬£2500? you have on of those with the engine etc removed and unsupported, unreliable running gear and a battery that was never intended for use on the road.

1252,2920418,"34    34
Name: Unnamed: 0, dtype: int64",775,"Nov 17, 2020","As an example of the issues. 
Take power steering. They use a 12v electro hydraulic system, under load these will pull 70amps. If you are driving in any complex way other than a straight line they will eat up the 12v supply. Just to keep up with the power steering demands, you need not only a big 12v battery but a 1kw 120v Dc to DC isnt cheap Even using a number of smaller ones in parallel thats going to cost between ¬£600 and ¬£1k.
If you then drive with lights on add another 10 amps, put the wipers and heater fan on, thats another 10 amps. etc etc.
So you will have to invest a lot just to cover the 12v needs. Many of the Allieds really surffered with 12v failures, and higher voltage can be more cost effective on DC to Dc front.
With a big pack you will need a higher power charger to even enable overnight charging. But 7kw 120v chargers are not that common, and a couple or three smaller ones will cost bet ween ¬£1 and 2k.
And so it goes on.
I have n Allied expertm its rubbish. I have spent far too much time and money on it and its going to be scrapped. I have just stripped another Expert pack, and it seemed ok, but its actually in a poor condition with many of the cells badly swollen. Its just not worth the time and effort.
I often get people wanting to convert a cheap car. Because they have it. If you have a ¬£500 fiesta, and spend ¬£20k converting it, you end up with an Electric ¬£500 fiesta, that no one would buy from you. If you are spending ¬£10ks on conversion do it to something thats got a value. 
Do it because you want to. But in doing so you have to understand what you are doing and be committed to spending a lot knowing you are unlikely to ever see your investment back. Even as parts.",2,None

Hello everyone, we are new here, and we do have a Peugeot partner tepee full electric vehicle which is from allied electric, or allied vehicles VB as it is known now,
We have posted a reply to someone on here that had a Peugeot partner tepee for sale but for spares or repair, and only had 16k in the clock, but looking at the post it was 6 months ago, so it may have been sold by now.
If not we are interested for parts for ours.
We are new to this, and we like our Peugeot partner, but any information on how to upgrade it, would be great

We are currently getting a cable made for us, so we can use the charge points up and down the country, commando plug at one end(for the car) and type 2 on the other end, as most points have type 2 available.

Is it possible to get the charger changed??
So the batteries could be charged much quicker?? Say in the rapid points??
As I understand lifepo4 VB batteries can be charged at most rates slow fast and rapid.
It's just the charger that's holding the charging rate back

Any help would be really appreciated

As an example of the issues.
Take power steering. They use a 12v electro hydraulic system, under load these will pull 70amps. If you are driving in any complex way other than a straight line they will eat up the 12v supply. Just to keep up with the power steering demands, you need not only a big 12v battery but a 1kw 120v Dc to DC isnt cheap Even using a number of smaller ones in parallel thats going to cost between ¬£600 and ¬£1k.
If you then drive with lights on add another 10 amps, put the wipers and heater fan on, thats another 10 amps. etc etc.
So you will have to invest a lot just to cover the 12v needs. Many of the Allieds really surffered with 12v failures, and higher voltage can be more cost effective on DC to Dc front.
With a big pack you will need a higher power charger to even enable overnight charging. But 7kw 120v chargers are not that common, and a couple or three smaller ones will cost bet ween ¬£1 and 2k.
And so it goes on.
I have n Allied expertm its rubbish. I have spent far too much time and money on it and its going to be scrapped. I have just stripped another Expert pack, and it seemed ok, but its actually in a poor condition with many of the cells badly swollen. Its just not worth the time and effort.
I often get people wanting to convert a cheap car. Because they have it. If you have a ¬£500 fiesta, and spend ¬£20k converting it, you end up with an Electric ¬£500 fiesta, that no one would buy from you. If you are spending ¬£10ks on conversion do it to something thats got a value.
Do it because you want to. But in doing so you have to understand what you are doing and be committed to spending a lot knowing you are unlikely to ever see your investment back. Even as parts.

Hello.
Hope you are well.
We have a Peugeot partner tepee (allied) and we have a slight problem, we select R (reverse) and nothing happens..... It bleeps as it should do, bit no power beneath the pedal, and the display still says N, even tho we are in R.
ANY HELP WOULD BE VERY WELCOME INDEED.
what could be the problem?
It sometimes does flash on screen R and back to N and says stop on a couple of occasions also, just for half a second or so, this happens both on its own when in Position Rand when we toggle from N to R.
Seems like some loose connection???
But we don't know where to look.!
Thank you",0,2920418

If you're still looking for help with the boxer drop me a message, I've got a pile of spares for them, and have managed to keep an allied expert going as a daily driver for 20,000 miles 
The state of charge on the axeon system is like a fruit machine, 100% can be triggered by a list of minor issues such as a single duff crimp, mine has often stopped a long way before the cells are actually charged, I'm in the process of ripping out the old battery electronics and replacing it with a decent modern system as my cells and motor have decent life left in them

Hahaha, not likely üòâ we really like the vehicle, and haven't had any troubles till this.
How do we check if the switch is working or not?
We know that may be a daft question, but not knowing how to work a multimeter, and not being an electrician, it's not something we know like the back of our hand sort of speak.
What do we set a multimeter at?
And what will it say if it's working?
And what will it say if it's not working?

We have now checked the switches below the gear knob.
And found 3, 2 are for reverse 1 for the Peugeot things reverse lights and bleeper, and 1 for the actual Reverse, Ansaldo side of things, and of course the 3rd one is for D drive.
We have checked them all, and they all seem to be working ok.
But when we try the one which should give us Reverse, the screen still says we are in N, and we are, because we can't move.
We tested the microswitches with a multimeter, 
And we got a new microswitch, and put the connections from the one in the car, onto that new microswitch, and pressed the switch and Still no reverse!......

Thanks Donald,

If anyone does require support with these then please let me know.

We have now built up quite a knowledge on them and already resolved some fairly major common issues.

If anyone gets an Allied Expert it is worth mentioning there is a very serious safety issue in the rear battery box where one of the high voltage cables gets 'pinched'. I would suggest that anyone that buys one gets it inspected. I have raised my concerns to allied but I can't see a recall happening!

I'll also mention that single phase is quite possibly a no go depending on which charger is fitted to the teepee. One model has no neutral so an adaptor wont work (at least safely).

Hello .
We have a Peugeot tepee (partner)
And we have had it for going on 5 years now with no issues.
The other day we couldn't get it to reverse, when you put the gear knob in R for reverse, on screen it still says N, and there is no power under the pedal,(still in N) presumably?....but the reverse lights are working and the bleeper is also.
We have checked under the cover and found 3 microswitches, and they all seem to be working, we even got a new microswitch and connected it to the existing 2 wire's from the bottom microswitch for R (reverse) which appears to be the ansaldo side of the reverse,
And activated the switch, and Nothing, still N on screen, and we even activated the tip microswitch (lights and bleeper),at same time and still nothing.
We love our car, and it's given us nearly 5 years of good electric motoring! And we have come to you for help, as we know from reading this , you are the person to go to for help and advice regarding these vehicles.
We just want to get it fixed please.
It drives forward absolutely fine.
But we can't have it with no reverse.
So PLEASE can you Help us.

Hi there, thank you very much, we are new to this thread blog thing, and we see when we looked through the most recent posts with Mike schooling, he seems to have washed his hands of these vehicles.
That's the reason we are asking for help as well from anyone else, in case when we do get in touch with Mike schooling, he says get rid of the vehicle like he's said before to people, 
and all we want is to get this fault fixed, 
as it is our only car,
It's what we use every day.
And we can't afford to get another vehicle.
Thank you for your advice though.
We will have a look and see if there are any of them garages near us while we wait for some advice from people who have had these vehicles.

Hi, firstly can I say that no previous or present owner of an Allied electric vehicle could have anything but sympathy for your current plight, but a wise man called Schooling once told me that the Peugeot electric vans converted by Allied were assembled from components that were best described as prototypes and that there were so many potential issues with their design and execution that they were not worth throwing good money after bad. If you fix one fault then the next one will come along and get it sooner or later. I, like many other paid ¬£5000 in late 2015 for a 5 year old car with 17k miles on it with a price when new of I believe ¬£28000. There is a very good reason why they were apparently such a bargain and the purchase was a initially risk due to the nature and history of the project with original users (exclusively Scottish local government) having sued and won against Allied for the vehicles failure to perform. That risk has become greater as firstly Allied withdrew their support then experts and enthusiastic amateurs alike concluded that the vehicles were basically unsupportable as the detail and scale of their shortcomings became apparent. I could have has mine repaired as it is a (conceptually) simple matter of opening the battery box and replacing a defective cell but the cost of the labour involved is prohibitive and beyond the value of the car and the risk of disturbing something else and creating another fault would be a major concern. 

I thought that mine was the last one in daily use on the road but it seems that yours could take that honour if you can get it repaired at reasonable cost. It seems that the obvious easy fix of the switch or wiring at at the gear lever has been covered, so now it needs electronics/electric car expertise. the suggestion of finding a Herva garage has already been made and out of curiosity I did a search here EV-friendly garages in the UK and found that there are 3 in your area, the furthest is about 30 miles. If you get a positive response then take the information about signal pinouts already given here to point them in the right direction. This forum has been very useful for sharing information for self help but the ability to help is limited if something arises that no one has had previous experience of and I can honestly say that after 7 years benefiting from and contributing to the sum total of knowledge (wanna know about rear springs I am your man!) I have never heard of one that will go forwards but not backwards! Good luck with your quest!

Hello Eddie, and firstly can we thank you Very much for your information and advice, yes it is quite unfortunate that they seem to have been put together so badly, and made so complicated! For which is really such a simple thing (electric vehicles)
Battery,
BMS
Motor controller
Motor (with existing gearbox)
And for their time 2011, they were a large EV, and if exicuted properly they COULD ja e been a really good vehicle.

Yes ours up until last week was running perfectly, and we are very happy with it, its currently on 64k miles,
And we are used to its little flaws, skidding and cutting out, and are used to driving it to minimise that happening haha.
We I will check out that search now and see if we can find one that can have a look at it for us.
We are going to have a look under the bonnet to see if we can find where the wire's go to, bit want to know if they go straight to the big plug at the front of the inverter, and if so, can we unplug it, or should we do something first? Ie unplugging the 12v battery or something else, before attempting to unplug that big plug.
As we could cut some cost down by checking the wires ourselves up to that point of the big plug.

Thank you very much for that honour Eddie, we are not sure if we are the last running one or not, we certainly want to keep her going!

On the springs front!.... When we get reverse working again, we would like to have a chat regarding springs, as it loves hitting it's bump stops!! Haha, and we could do with some new ones.

We will keep you informed as to our progress,
And trust us to have the only one that goes forward and not backwards!!! Hahahaha.

Thanks again, and I suppose it's nice for you to get your drive back, and more space again.

Take care, and thank you.",0,3256884

Hello there.
We took our car to an auto electrician this morning,
The one nearest to us an hevra garage, and a very nice chap he is too, very competent, and knows what he's doing.
He has concluded the following....
A. The wires on the wiring diagram that refers to the microvet do not correspond.
On that the wires are pink and lilac for forward and reverse, and the wire for forward is green!

B. The pins 8 and 27 forward and reverse, are Empty at the plug to the inverter......
So we have no idea which wire is the reverse.

C. He has confirmed that the drive and reverse signals from the microswitches reach the circuit board in the White box if tricks at the Left side under the bonnet, where a circuit board is located.
The signals go into the board via a small plug (from microswitches)
And come out via a lot larger plug next to it, which goes to the inverter.

D. The signal does Not come out of the large plug in that white box to go to the inverter

So in a nutshell, the signal from the microswitches goes to the circuit board in the white box, but the board isn't throwing the signal back out.

Does anyone have any ideas?
Or does anyone know a contact at Allied??
Because the wires do not tally with the diagram, the electrician wants a Pin out diagram of that board in the white box then he can determine which wire is the reverse that comes out of the board via the large plug which goes to the inverter.

Many thanks indeed.",0,3257230

Thank you for the update with details of the investigation so far. It is encouraging that you have made some progress.
I am sorry that the wiring information relating to Micro-Vett was of no use. Hopefully someone with actual experience of the Allied wiring for the inverter control signals will respond to this thread.

Hello,

Thank you for the update with details of the investigation so far. It is encouraging that you have made some progress.
I am sorry that the wiring information relating to Micro-Vett was of no use. Hopefully someone with actual experience of the Allied wiring for the inverter control signals will respond to this thread.

Hello there,
Your very welcome indeed, and it's no problem at all, it's not your fault regarding the wiring diagram for the micro-vett.
Obviously allied wired everything up differently! Haha,
We have tried to contact Allied, to see if they have a spare board laying around somewhere, this was before we got your reply.
No joy yet!
I have sent a message to Graz 79.
And am awaiting a reply still.

When you talk about reverse-engeneering the board, do you mean for us to tell the auto electrician this? And for him to do this?
Or do you want photos of both sides of the board?
Yes the reverse and forward signals enter the board via a small loom from the gear lever/microswitches, and gather into a small plug, think there's 6 wires.

I have tried to get hold of Mike schooling a few times but without success......
I even tried Indra, but only got to liaise with someone called Chloe. And got no further, just got told they hadn't worked on these cars since 2018, and that was it.

Yes I echo your comments, if anyone on here has any information regarding the inverter wiring signals?
Or pin out diagrams of the circuit board in the white box and inverter?
We would be Very greatfull indeed.

Ok we just have to wait I suppose......
Thank you very much indeed, if you can let us know.
As our can is sat at the auto electricians currently.

Or has he changed it??
As it's strange he hasn't replied yet.

We are going to borrow the neighbours car to go to the auto electrician today to see if he's managed to find out anything, unfortunately we can't go with any news of a board or diagram yet.... But we can show him your information Eddie, regarding the reverse engineering bit.

Firstly thank you so very much for supplying this information.
We really do appreciate it very much.

We've had ours now for over 4 year's and done just over 69k miles
With no problems.
So hopefully this information will help our auto electrician.

Hi, firstly can I say that no previous or present owner of an Allied electric vehicle could have anything but sympathy for your current plight, but a wise man called Schooling once told me that the Peugeot electric vans converted by Allied were assembled from components that were best described as prototypes and that there were so many potential issues with their design and execution that they were not worth throwing good money after bad. If you fix one fault then the next one will come along and get it sooner or later. I, like many other paid ¬£5000 in late 2015 for a 5 year old car with 17k miles on it with a price when new of I believe ¬£28000. There is a very good reason why they were apparently such a bargain and the purchase was a initially risk due to the nature and history of the project with original users (exclusively Scottish local government) having sued and won against Allied for the vehicles failure to perform. That risk has become greater as firstly Allied withdrew their support then experts and enthusiastic amateurs alike concluded that the vehicles were basically unsupportable as the detail and scale of their shortcomings became apparent. I could have has mine repaired as it is a (conceptually) simple matter of opening the battery box and replacing a defective cell but the cost of the labour involved is prohibitive and beyond the value of the car and the risk of disturbing something else and creating another fault would be a major concern.

I thought that mine was the last one in daily use on the road but it seems that yours could take that honour if you can get it repaired at reasonable cost. It seems that the obvious easy fix of the switch or wiring at at the gear lever has been covered, so now it needs electronics/electric car expertise. the suggestion of finding a Herva garage has already been made and out of curiosity I did a search here EV-friendly garages in the UK and found that there are 3 in your area, the furthest is about 30 miles. If you get a positive response then take the information about signal pinouts already given here to point them in the right direction. This forum has been very useful for sharing information for self help but the ability to help is limited if something arises that no one has had previous experience of and I can honestly say that after 7 years benefiting from and contributing to the sum total of knowledge (wanna know about rear springs I am your man!) I have never heard of one that will go forwards but not backwards! Good luck with your quest!

As to your offer of interest in buying mine. Wofforduk have come to an arrangement regarding mine and I will soon have space on my drive but I am not sure how you buying mine would help your problem!?

Hello there.
Hope you are well, and we took your advice and contacted the nearest hevra approved garage to us, and it was Berwains service center, and a very nice Man he was too, he certainly knows his stuff, and in no time at all he had confirmed that it was a problem in the white box under the bonnet, left hand side with lots of wires in it.
And there's a circuit board in the bottom of it, and after further analysis, and after wiring diagrams from Mike schooling (thank you so much Mike!)
He tracked it to the 5v signal not going to the throttle potentiometer.
So he took the circuit board out, and took it to a friend of his who has a hi-fi repair shop!
And he found the problem, it was 3 quarters of the socket where the small plug fits which has the wires coming from the gear lever and brake pedal and throttle potentiometer, it had a lot of corrosion on it.
So he cleaned it all up, and also found that the copper tracks had some corrosion too and were beyond repair, so he has put some Bridges in underneath the board.
What a BRILLIANT man.
And the car is working fine now, we can reverse!! üôÇ
I will ask him for the photos so we can put them on here.
Many many thanks to you, and to everyone who helped us.

Hi Eddie.
Hope your well.
Good news!!
Our auto electrician has fixed it,!! üôÇ
After we got the info from Mike schooling, I sent it to him, and he had yours too, and he managed to find out that the signal that goes to the throttle potentiometer from the board (5v) isn't going, and that was the problem, 
Because after he had probed around with his multimeter probes and pulled a couple of plugs and put them back in, we could not go forward either! Haha, it turned out it was nothing to do with him doing anything, it just happened to conk out while it was there which was great!
And he took the circuit board out, took it to a friend of his who repairs hi-fi and TV circuit boards, and he found the socket where the plug goes that house the wire's from the microswitches and throttle potentiometer and brakes etc, had corrosion on it quite bad, so he cleaned it all up, and also the copper tracks were damaged, so he put bridges in underneath the board, and found something else that had blown, something black we think, we will ask him for the photos so we can send them to you.
We are so happy we are up and running again it's brilliant and John at Burwains service center and his mate who repaired the circuit board are absolutely Amazing!! We can't thank them enough.
And you too Eddie.
We will keep in touch, as we want to focus on our springs next, think it's epnr that has the springs and knows about them?

Hello there.
We currently have our car in at the auto electrician again, we just wanted him to check all the cells for us and see if there was any that needed replacing, and check the soc, that they all were the same voltage etc, a health check to put it simply.
And he asked us if there were any cells that needed replacing while he was in there, could we get hold of any?
So here we are, are we right in thinking that you have some?
2nd hand cells from a Peugeot partner tepee, I think they are 110ah ones bu that's as far as we know, and not sure if the make of them either.
It says Axeon underneath on the box, but that's as much as we know.

We've looked at the brochure that we downloaded from here, and it says they are 110ah cells and there's 84 of them, it doesn't say the name or make of them, does this matter??
Obviously the Ah matters, as if it's different from the rest of the cells you have an immediate in- balance.
Is it the expert and or boxer that have thundersky cells?

So just wondering if anyone on here has any spare ones for an Allied Peugeot partner tepee.?
I thought we had read somewhere that someone had some, but not 100 percent sure.

Id put money on the fact that some people on here have these cells in their warehouses but are just not willing to sell them to any allied owners  

Here is the link to the cell that I bought, I might buy a few more and have them shipped by sea as will be a lot cheaper so if you wanted any let me know and I can add some more in the order. I tested the one and it clocks up correctly, shouldn't make too many odds mixing the packs, the limit will be the other cells if that makes sense!

Hi we've just been up to the auto electrician and took some photos, it's the 3 connections on the back box and the 2 on the front, they are differing sizes with one whopping big one on the front box.
All round ones which seem to screw off.
Can you get new ones of these??

Hello Mike.
Hope your well, thank you so very much indeed for the information you provided for us, it Really helped, and we are back on the road, 
However we asked our auto electrician to check the condition of our cells, as we dare not go below 50 percent charge, because last year we partial charged the car quite a few times, and we didn't know that you Can't do this on these vehicles.....
So f forward to now, and he has dropped the battery, and checked All the cells.
And they are perfectly alternating from their neighbour 1 cell is 3.4 and the one next door is 3.2 and the one next door is 3.4 and the next one is 3.2 and so on, all the 84 cells are like this.
He is asking if it should be like this??
He thinks not 
he thinks they should all be the same voltage.
So before he starts to open up the BMS he wants to be sure.

He thinks that part of the BMS isn't working properly.
And we've been told your the man that will know.

We hope you can help.

Many thanks indeed",0,3261204

The Ansaldo motor is probably almost bomb proof, and if a bearing were to go it should be an easy fix. The matching inverter has had problems and aparently are prone to damage in a number of ways, these were one of the issues that were had with Glasgow. Although there appears to have been suggestions that it was operator abuse. ie they did something in a way not intended and that gives a problem. Ansaldo do not respond to any email address published, neither do the parent company who own them. They no longer publish any information on the EV parts.
Fortunately the Inverter is actually very basic device built up internally from a series of quite large circuit boards, so board level repairs are possible, however the Spike issue wipes some part of its memory requiring not only potentially component repairs but a re load of data. I believe Allied can do that.
Allied do still have some spares, and recently supplied a board for an inverter that I removed from a customers Partner. The three phase chargers do appear to have the single phase option, and the Italian makers will repair them (Another customer has just sent his for repair) The three phase/singlephase unit uses the connection between phases 1 and 2 for single phase, not using neutral as you would expect. These make of chargers are used in a number of conversions, but they are mostly sold as OEM kit so they do not sell singly having a large single order value, and only make them to order / requirements.
The Battery pack was made by Axeon, who are now Johnson Matthey batteries, and used old versions of the BMS but basically the same as used in the Modec truck. Neither of which Axeon now support, or hold spares for, having cleared out all legacy parts and information when they became JMB. The cells are standard parts, and I do have a few ex Modec BMS parts in stock. Being Lifepo4 the cells are fairly good, and single cell replacements are possible and a whole pack is not required if a cell failure occurs.
As with any Conversion, co-operation by the builders would make life a lot easier, but also like most conversions there will have been a continual change in the way the conversions were carried out and some of the components will have changed.
I know of two chargers that have died because of spikes on the mains in rural areas where supply is poor, as well as one inverter being damaged during charge by spikes. This sounds odd, but according to Allied service chap is a common problem, The inverter being on the main power circuit during charge and the charger gives out a short high voltage DC spike following the AC spike, and that damages the Inverter.
Allied still have about 18 vehicles , not part of the Glasgow deal, and will continue to support them as long as they are in warranty, beyond that is unknown, but they already have few people who know the vehicles left / working on the EV side. But they are unwilling to relinquish support / have competition while those vehicles are still viable/ being supported by them. But not unwilling to consider a different approach long term, both Mike Schooler and I appear to have approached Allied on this front.

Hello Jeremy.
We were wondering if you still had some BMS and parts available??
As you can see above in the messages, we have our battery pack out, and our auto electrician has checked all the cells, (see photos) and they are different voltages.
Perfectly alternating with their neighbours the cells are 3.4 -3.2 -3.4 -3.2 -3.4 -3.2 and so on.
Should they all be the same??

If so is it indicating something wrong with one of the BMS units??

And back to our first question, do you have any parts??

If you could please let us know.

It is the only sensible option. 

Sell the cells to the diy powerwall crowd, scrap the shell, buy a ¬£1500 runabout with what you make.

The only way forward with these is to rebuild the pack with an alternative BMS, Batrium, REC or Orion.

Capitals are generally considered to be shouting, when used on forums.... Anyway, back to the task at hand. You need to figure out what is supposed to happen to the pack contactors and the inverter enable circuitry when the key is turned. That should be your electricians first place to look.

He just wondered if there was a certain procedure to putting things back? that maybe he hadn't done, with not knowing another vehicle like this, and he wanted to know if anyone who had the same vehicle knew anything, or had been in a similar situation.

It‚Äôs just a bit safer to measure the output of that, than it is to start probing around the HV wiring.

It was a Bent Pin!! On one of the amphenol type plugs......

Also we just wanted to ask if anyone's had the following little niggle with their vehicle??
When going downhill mostly we apply the brakes gently (regenerative braking kicks in as it should) then it cuts out, but it's like it's trying not to.....and then it finally does cut out, and we've to pull in, and re start it, and usually it's ok from then on, sometimes it does it twice, and it's always when we first get in it in a morning.
Never in the day when it's been used.
It's Always first thing after its not been used for a day or after a night's charge.

It's very similar to what happens when you hit some ice, or skid ever so slightly, and the car trips out, only difference is it doesn't cut out dead, like what happens when you skid or slide,
It jitters on and off, like if your in 5th gear in a ice car and you should be in 2nd, like it's struggling......then it goes off after about 5 to 8 seconds.

And this only happens when I approach the break peddle lightly, going downhill, upon first trip out either after a night charging
Or just after being left for a day and not used.
After it's done it once or sometimes twice on the first journey out, it's fine then for the rest of the day,!!

Confused by this comment - 75% charge just means the car wasn't fully charged - so what ?

Or do you mean 75% State of Health ? Two different things...

The diagnostic tool for the Ion doesn't actually report a State of Health figure (not anywhere I could find anyway) and only reports battery health in terms of Ah, (Ampere Hour) where 46Ah is roughly 100% State of Health.

The level of charge of the battery has nothing to do with the seat heater working or not, in any case.

Don't bother - as Andrew mentioned already later cars don't work in the unlocked B mode. Not sure what the cutover year is where they stopped working but a 2017 is definitely too late for this to work as there are multiple confirmed ""doesn't work"" reports from various people who have tried it.

From what I've read the lift off regeneration was increased in the later Ion's and C-Zero's anyway - it sounds a bit like D mode in the later models is equivalent to the unlocked B mode in the earlier models, however not having driven both old and new I couldn't say for sure.",1,None

Hello everyone,

I was wondering if owners of the e2008 are getting any more updates on their Peugeot app. I remember doing an update immedtiately after I got the car back in August. But nothing more since then. The Tom Tom got two map updates, I had done one immediately with the touchscreen update back in August and another one maybe one or two months later can't remember. Nothing more since then.

I'm asking because the Peugeot app here is not officially supported in Malta and while I can use all the features, I'm wondering if it's a case of no available updates, or if these are ""hidden"" for me because I'm based in Malta.

Good day everyone!

Adjusting the handbrake cable alone is unlikely to solve the issue, the drum brakes need a clean and overhaul - they will probably be ""grabby"" and need the shoe linings chamfering at at the edges and the interface between the shoes and backplates lubricating, and then the handbrake cable adjusting at the end of that.

Interesting things to note:

Best range: Calm driving, HVAC off, 25¬∞C outside temp @ 25 mph = 254 miles
Worst range: Dynamic driving, HVAC on, -10¬∞C outside temp @ 80 mph = 77 miles
25-30 mph appears to be the range sweet spot, this changes when the HVAC is on as 30-40 mph becomes the new sweet spot depending on the temperature.
Large amounts of range loss occurs when pushing between 40-55 mph.
The HVAC system is more efficent at higher speeds as the heat pump becomes more efficient working in tandem with the HVAC. For example at -10¬∞C & HVAC on driving at 25 mph nets you 125 miles but driving at 40 mph gives you 133 miles but going above 40 mph reduces your range again.
Similar to the above point the HVAC becomes more efficient the more air you pump into it with a similar curve when speed increases. For example at 35¬∞C & HVAC on driving at 25mph nets you 150 miles but driving at 40mph gives you 164 miles but going above 40 mph reduces your range again.
All of the assumptions above are based on the range calculator alone. I'm hoping to do some real-world testing at some point

Maybe you are right. But I ordered the car when they quoted and still do 206 miles. I spoke to the garage in depth re the mileage achievable and was told it would easily do the mileage I needed. I looked into other cars like the Ioniq that had smaller batteries that would not make the mileage I needed although would be close. The general consensus was that the extra size in the battery should more than equate to the mileage I needed.
The only way Manufacturers can provide a consistent range is to use proper testing and reporting of the cars range, WLTP clearly over states this on Peugeot and the fact they added a range checker months after I had ordered the car, meant I had the ability to check before it went into production.

As for you thoughts on a 150 mile journey without stops, my journey is in fact a 150 there, stay over night and 150 home again. I care for my elderly parents every weekend, driving down with kids and dogs in car to their house. this happens most weekends, and would now need to stop on the way down just to reach my destination, trickle charging overnight as they don't have a charger at their house, and then stopping again on the way back home again.

Maybe you are right. But I ordered the car when they quoted and still do 206 miles. I spoke to the garage in depth re the mileage achievable and was told it would easily do the mileage I needed. I looked into other cars like the Ioniq that had smaller batteries that would not make the mileage I needed although would be close. The general consensus was that the extra size in the battery should more than equate to the mileage I needed.
The only way Manufacturers can provide a consistent range is to use proper testing and reporting of the cars range, WLTP clearly over states this on Peugeot and the fact they added a range checker months after I had ordered the car, meant I had the ability to check before it went into production.

As for you thoughts on a 150 mile journey without stops, my journey is in fact a 150 there, stay over night and 150 home again. I care for my elderly parents every weekend, driving down with kids and dogs in car to their house. this happens most weekends, and would now need to stop on the way down just to reach my destination, trickle charging overnight as they don't have a charger at their house, and then stopping again on the way back home again. For me, thats just silly and something I would not commit to. Once I can get the range to get there and charge over night fully for the return then.

And for reference, as my wife will contest, we traipsed around 5 Peugeot dealers over 3 weekends, talking to each about the car and its expected range.. At that time, they all quoted that it would make it without issue.",1,2811506

My original plans on the car were to drive to parents expecting to use around 35 Kw ish and charging overnight for about 18 hours with some to spare and then driving home. As it went on it looked more and more that I would be using a lot more and charging time would go up to 20-22 hours, even with a spot charge on the way down. The more I looked, the more it was going to become an annoyance and not the fab one I dreamed about. Traffic has been an issue a lot in the last year, almost every over trip and I know me and what I am like. I was gutted if I am honest, however, I have brought the 2008 1.2 EAT 8 petrol. In hindsight I shouldn't have gone for a car before it was released so I could have gotten real world figures.
Its not all bad though, as the wife will be getting the E-208 probably as soon as the right one comes up secondhand later this year and I will use that in the summer as well, it does have a larger range and when I am on my own I could go off motorway and guarantee I would make it. The rest of the time I am finishing work, in the car and driving down, all a bit of a rush.
Its all good, just will look again in a few years, and for me I may go for a Kia Niro or similar as I suspect I will suffer range anxiety otherwise ",0,2811575

There are but then the costs more than double. I am all for EV, just for me it works if you can complete 90% of your journeys charged at home, as this is my main journey, the other is about 320 miles return trip to my wife's family, thats the other alternate weekends, which I did expect to have to top up on but these are generally in more friendly hours to the family travelling with me.

If it happened after wet conditions during winter my first guess is that salt water could have done something to the brakes resulting in a little bit of brake binding and therefore drag.

It doesn't take much drag from a binding brake to kill the range - I had problems with the rear left drum on mine binding and sometimes seizing altogether and I was also noticing reduced range at the time. (Although not by as much as you're reporting)

See my thread about brakes in this section of the forum. Brakes on these seem to need a little bit of attention now and then to keep them working well. As well as a quick overhaul and clean of the rear drums due to binding I had to replace the front discs and pads as well as the discs were extremely corroded and slightly warped.

There is also a rubber bush on one of the front caliper slide pins which if greased with mineral grease by mistake will swell up and cause the pin to start jamming - this can also cause brake binding.",0,None

Hi All,

I have been on the side lines for quite a while, so I thought I'd give the forum a chance to purchase a white Peugeot Ion we have for sale.

We are a electric car only family - we first started with a Leaf (Wife's car now), then the Peugeot Ion, and now a BMW i3 rex.

The reason for the sale of the Peugeot Ion is that the BMW i3 is a company car and I no longer need the Ion.

I bought the Ion in Sept 2015 from a main Peugeot Dealership (before I knew about the company car option in January 2016 - I now have to travel further for work hence the i3 rex). They had it up for ¬£6495, but I paid ¬£6000 outright with no finance. It is a great car and has been perfect for my commute to work, around town and easy to park .

The Ion comes with an MOT until 18.09.2016, and warranty until 20.09.2016 (subject to a ¬£25 transfer admin fee to Peugeot.)

Car has done 18900 miles (I did over 1000 miles in the car)

Condition is very good inside and out, with only slight wear and tear of a 3.5 year old car!

We am based in Stroud, Gloucestershire.

For sale ¬£5,250 ono.

A great electric car at a low price, maybe get someone started with an EV car before a Tesla!

If you have any questions, please do not hesitate to ask.

Cheers
John.

Thanks for the offer. I may put some more thought into this after all then. Will drop both yourself and OP a private message later if I can make the numbers work and can arrange the time to take a look at it and such.

Yes, with the rear seats down you can actually get a lot in them due to the high ceiling and boxy shape. They actually do very well in Bjorn's banana box test when the rear seats are down compared to other cars with the rear seat down.

Also I've discovered that because the base of the windscreen is so far forward standard 2.4 metre beams of wood / poles fit down the middle of the car between the boot and front windscreen (wrapped up in a towel on the dashboard to avoid scratches) even with 4 passengers in the car!

In my considerably larger petrol car 2.4 metre beams can't quite fit between boot and windscreen and instead have to poke out the passenger window, which means no front left passenger... it's remarkable what we've managed to squeeze into the Ion at times...",1,2802100

It should charge up ok (as long as the car starts)
But if a new battery is flat I'd advise returning it immediately as you don't know how long it's been discharged for.
it will charge ok, just by having the car on (in ready to go mode) for a couple of hours so you don't really need a charger (though they are useful to have)

Click to expand...

If your work charger is 11kW it likely is a 16A 3ph charging unit and therefore the maximum charge rate for a single-phase equipped car - like yours - would be 3.6kW.

To get faster charging you would need to either plug into a 22kW charger (3 x 7.2kW ~ 32A per phase giving you up to 7.2kW) or have an 11kW-capable car (which would increase the charging rate on your car to 11kW.)

There is no way around this unfortunately. 

However 3.6kW should charge a modern EV at about 14 miles per hour, so it seems that your 80 miles after 8-9 hours is a little low. Not sure why, but maybe the range-meter in your car is pessimistic.",0,3183342

It was fine during a test drive but it's hard to evaluate the comfort of a seat until you've driven in it for long periods of time.

I'm 6 foot and possibly have long leg shorter torso proportions, which means even with the seat height set to maximum my knees are way up in the air and there is absolutely zero thigh support with all my weight resting on a small region of my backside around the tailbone...The seat base is not reclined back at all like it is in most cars, so this makes it feel like I'm trying to slide off the seat towards the front of the car. Very uncomfortable! I can't get comfortable in any car that doesn't have proper thigh support, especially when the seat is this low to the floor.

I've investigated the possibility of a wedge shaped pillow, but they all seem to be made with the intention of putting the thick end of the wedge at the base of the seat to compensate for bucket seats that recline too much, but I have exactly the opposite problem - I need to raise the end closest to the front of the car, and the available wedges are not long enough to go right to the end of the seat.

I experimented with ordinary pillows but nothing works. So I think I'm going to have to modify the seat by adding some spacers under the seat mounts at the front to lift the front of the seat up about an inch. I saw an article from a Leaf owner who had a similar problem (despite the leaf having a rake adjustment for the base) where he just couldn't get any thigh support, and even raising it 3/4"" made all the difference for him.

Has anyone else performed any modification to the their seat to give it more thigh support ?

I'm only 6 foot and have to move the seat relatively far back. Even though my knees are only a couple of inches from the dashboard in this position I find the steering wheel further away than is comfortable.

I also found the base of the seat far too horizontal to be comfortable for me - so much so that I ended up putting a layer of about 4 washers under the front seat fixing points on the floor to tilt the entire seat base back slightly.

On top of this I have to have some foam padding and a heated seat cover (with it's own padding) on the seat before it is tolerably comfortable for me as the bare unmodified seat is incredibly hard - it's just a very hard inflexible foam with a tiny bit of cloth over it. No spring suspension here!

The seat is also completely absent of any side bolstering so apart from holding onto the steering wheel there is nothing to support you through corners.

In short the standard unmodified Ion seats are excruciatingly uncomfortable for me - definitely one of the major weaknesses of the car. I would say it's an even bigger weakness than the range in day to day use. More range would be useless as the standard seats are too uncomfortable to drive in for any further than the current range!",0,None

If you want to use the charger timer then DO NOT set the car deferred timer. I'm not familiar with your charger but like with the PodPoint, you can set a schedule for charging and with the tariff details in your profile, it will give your charging costs.

As the car can ONLY give you a deferred START time, it is no good setting that together with your charger scheduler. For example, if you set a schedule for 00:30 to 04:30 on your charger, if the car has a deferred start time of, say 16:00, even if the charger activates, the car will not accept a charge until the next occurrence of 16:00, ie. later that day.

If your charger is failing to initiate the charge and you have no active, deferred start schedule on the car, then that is a different problem and probably something to do with the charger itself or that was it communicates with the car.

If you have not activated a deferred charge start time on your car, the light by the socket should stay white after you plug it in. As and when the charger starts its scheduled charge, the light by the socket will flash green. If the charger ends its charge at the scheduled time, the light should go white again and eventually switch off altogether.

If you have a scheduled charge start time in the cat, the light will be blue. If it's blue and you have a scheduled start time for your charger, make sure you turn the cars scheduled start time off.

In the cars app, under ""Charge"", if your cable is plugged in but not charging (ie. a deferred charge has been scheduled} the ""switch"" under the charge scale will be greyed out on the ""deferred charge"" side. What the means is that there is a cable plugged in but not charging. If the ""switch"" is blue and on the deferred charge"" side, then your car's deferred timer is active and no matter what your charger is set to, it will not accept a charge until the deferred time. If it reaches the deferred time and the charger has not reached its scheduled charge time, nothing will happen and the app will show ""charge interrupted"".

So, make sure you get your head around the differences between the cars scheduled charge timer and your EVSE scheduled timer.

I've had my 2011 Ion since Jan 2014 having bought it used from Howards of Taunton for ¬£9k5 with 2k5 miles on it. So impressed with every aspect of it that I pursuaded my brother who lives in Devon to replace his aging diesel Ford Escort estate with one. He bought much the same but for ¬£8k from Howards of Yeoville.

The only winge I have is that you can't deactivate creep. Beyond that it is the best car I've owned in 40-odd years of motoring... up until I bought my Tesla!

If you can charge it at home (or work) and are not in the habit of doing either long trips or multi trips throughout the day when charging speed might be an issue (unless you operate near a rapid) I would not hesitate but don't pay any more than ¬£7k - less if the miles are much more than 7K or older than a 2012 version. I get about 30% range remaining (I have an OVMS transponeder fitted) after 45 miles round trip commute in summer but it really does depend on how fast you drive - I normally do 70 for half my commute and 40 odd for the rest.

Even long trips are reasonably practical - I took mine down to my brother's from E Herts 4 times - 400 miles round trip - using ecotricity's and Nissan's rapids. All Nissan dealerships that I met were very accomodating with the rapids - ring first tho! Just bank on taking about 30 to 50% longer to drive the journey than in an ICEV. I got to quite enjoy the enforced stops - relaxing.

The i-MiEV is really quite nippy and you can leave all but the most ardent boy-racers behind at the lights without even trying. Top speed is a max of 80-odd.

Hey Tats,

So the car in question was a 69 plate car. Reg EF69 WUP. I purchased the car from Harlow Peugeot. They werent very helpful. They done their checks. Couldnt find anything. I had asked podpoint to refit the charger. As a result i applied quite abit of pressure on Harlow Peugeot. Threatened legal action and forced through a buy back.

You cant sell a electric car that doesnt charge. I ended up negotiating a discount on a 21 plate E208. 

I did ask about the 69 plate one delivery day. It got sold on after a week. With the customer complaining of the same issue. They then done more checks. It was a charger issue. As you had mentioned. I was told the warranty bill was over ¬£7k

Hi,
I'm getting a clunking noise when I'm accelerating and lift off the peddle. I've took it to a local, none EV, garage, who have had a look and they think the noise is coming from the gearbox. Has anyone had an issue with one before? Can anyone recommend a garage that would be happy to fix it, in Yorkshire, or close?

BEVs are different in that they use the battery exclusively (obviously  ) and in a different way. I recon you'll get 10 years or 100k miles with ease, though probably not both. The older hybrid batteries seem to have a shelf life almost regardless of mileage and start to corrode internally about the 10/11 year mark. Saying that, a replacement is about ¬£800 now or about the same cost of a clutch in a manual car. When the batteries were new 10 years ago the cost was about ¬£8,000 - then!

Our C-Zero had an extended warranty/service package included, so I can't quote service costs.

We have had our car for almost two years and haven't seen any deterioration in range yet. It seems that sensible operation (not leaving the car fully charged or discharged for extended periods) protects the battery.

The iMiEV battery implementation is very conservative ‚Äì '100%' isn't really fully charged, there is some capacity headroom; and 0% isn't fully discharged either. If you plug into a CHAdeMO rapid charger you will see a 10% disparity between the car's indicated state of charge and that displayed by the rapid.

The motor doesn't require any maintenance. At some point it may require replacement brushes but that's pretty unlikely. If you think about it, industrial motors in factories are run 24/7 without any maintenance ‚Äì that's 8000 hours of operation in a year, which for a car averaging 30 mph equates to 240,000 miles!

With the car's implementation of regenerative braking, the disc pads should last a lot longer than on an ICE.

My experience of dozens and dozens dozens of EVs is that partial discharge and recharge, and not full cycling does seem to give the cells a better performance for longer. Taking cells very low discharge levels seems to cause the most degradation in life. But most of the makers dont let you get to the low levels, or indeed fully charge the cells. So when you see 0% the pack has probably got 10% or more left, and you dont get the opportunity to take the pack too low and into the voltage levels where damage could take place. But a vehicle left unused for a long period of time may discharge to a dangerous level. I have had to bring back to life packs that have gone too low for the onboard chargers to function.
On EVs especially ones with regen braking, the front brake discs seem to need replacing more often, not through wear but through corrosion, especially on the inside. So this needs to be checked during service. The surface of the disc and pad can get a hard polished oxide coating that looks nice and grey like the cast iron of the disc, but the performance is very poor. I also see some degradation of rubber suspension bushes, where the extra weight of the vehicles over their ICE parts sources can cause premature ageing. Most common is the need for front tracking adjustment.
Rubbish in air intakes and cooling fins is also an issue, as well is checking for any cable damage (age cracking not just physical). So while an EV has fewer moving parts, a decent service should be looking at not only normal vehicle part wear but also looking at the EV specific issues that could lead to failures. Many dealers have few staff who have had the training on their EVs so you may also be paying a premium for a skill for which they have a limited resource of.
Unless you are trying to see how a pack is likely to fail, I dont see any value in discharging and charging a pack, you would have to extract and look at a lot of data (and understand what you are seeing) on a cell by cell basis for such a practice to have any real value..

It is extremely unlikely, ie impossible, in a permanent magnet motor. Is it an externally excited motor? I don't believe so.

The only real service operation is the replacement of the reduction box/final drive lubricant(s). If it was a car I bought new and was keeping forever I'd tend to replace it within the first 10k miles and then forget about it for 5 years or more.

if you have a regular 200mile journey, a PHEV isn‚Äôt for you.

- It drives very nicely; handling, suspension and even acceleration are surprising and often bring a smile to my face.

- I love the design, inside and out. I reckon Peugeot really made an effort to make an interesting little car. Very subjective, but 5 months on, I still love seeing it on the drive and sitting in it.

- It charges quickly on rapids. I had unwarranted concerns before getting mine that I might find sitting at a rapid to be a huge time waster and encumberance. In practice, the combination of a good charge rate and smaller battery makes things very quick

Bits I wish were better:

- The app and associated digital services. Stellantis have really dropped the ball with an unreliable and temperamental app/backend. I hope they are working on it, and I‚Äôm sure I read somewhere that a Citroen customer had been told a wide-ranging update was in the works (can‚Äôt find where I read that now)

- odd UI decisions - no battery percentage. Many people find that the GOM (indicated range) is fairly unreliable and learning to read the mpkWh and battery percentage is the way to get proper assurance on a longer trip. They could have done this better IMO.

Personally, the car meets my range needs very nicely - most of my journeys are local, and roughly once or twice a week I might do a circa 140 mile round trip. People who regularly drive further might run in to range anxiety far more regularly than I, so the key thing is to make sure it fits your personal needs range wise.

I‚Äôve seen a few people who are bothered by the steering wheel (I like it).

Thank you very much. That was very comprehensive and informative. The range per se does not bother me as a trip to work and back is 26 miles. As long as it allows me to calculate approximately how much range I've got, I'm happy. Also is the recommendation still to charge it to 80 % ? Thank you.",0,3181504

You‚Äôre welcome.

Well, the 80% thing seems controversial as I think the car has quite a buffer at the top end. Personally, I usually do charge up to around 80 for a weekly charge as it is perfectly adequate for my general needs - but then will charge up to 100 when I‚Äôm off for a bigger journey on the weekend.",2,3181542

I'd imagine drop in range is to be expected with EVs in winters. My Leaf tends to give about 3-3.5 miles/ Kwh in winter and 4-5 Kwh in the summer.

Blind spot detection has a known bug where it thinks it's on, but it is not, and you have to toggle it off and then on again.
Tiny glovebox on right-hand-drive vehicles due to fuse box in same location as left-hand-drive vehicles.
Slightly smaller boot than Leaf.
Slightly less legroom in back seats than Leaf. The car's a smaller car. I didn't expect huge space. Not an issue for me.
Fusebox on RHD vehicle almost impossible to work on (e.g. to fit a hard-wired dashcam).

No battery % on dash, just a guessometer and analog-looking fuel gauge.
No ability to limit AC charge rate from dash.
No ability to charge to a particular percentage.

Nice stuff, compared to the Leaf:

Satnav and firmware updates relatively easy to install, and data is a lot fresher than the here.com data the ZE0/AZE0 Leaf uses. My Leaf's satnav data was over 3 years old when new.

Me too - that's why I bought the Ohme cable. Car will only allow a start time to be set and it then charges to 100% and stops. My EO charger app allowed me to set a charging window in terms of time but not percentage charge. With Ohme I use the Peugeot app to tell me the % state of charge - right now its 50%. I will tell my Ohme app to add 30% tonight and it will do it automatically during Octopus Go tariff time and will charge at less than 7kW if necessary so its nice and gentle.

No harm in charging to 100% if you need the range immediately but repeated charging (especially on rapids) to 100% and then letting the vehicle stand for any length of time at a high state of charge is definitely not recommended. Same with leaving the vehicle at a low state of charge.",1,3182042

cell balancing can (and should) happen at any state of charge with any battery pack, not just when it's nearly full, and not just when the vehicle is parked and charging. That's the primary job of the BMS, to spot which cells in the pack have a higher or lower voltage than others, and apply shunts to make sure that there's a minimum voltage difference between cells in the pack.
Then of course, the reported state of charge from the battery pack is often artificially fudged so that what is reported as 100% is actually something more like 95%. Many vehicles do this, so that there's always some room for storing regen power, making the regen experience the same regardless of how full the battery pack is.",1,3182042

The pug 208 has active cell balancing?

So every cell can be monitored and then charged individually?

I thought it was done passively by bouncing off the max and min ranges.

The totally battery pack is protected by the additional unused above and below the man and min (that‚Äôs 0% and 100% allowed by pug)

The lower-profile tyres, with larger wheel-diameter on the GT and GT-Line trim level does make you feel potholes more than I did on my 2014 Leaf. Not the end of the world, because there's nothing stopping you fitting aftermarket different wheels and tyres on a GT with a more traditional wheel profile. It seems that most car companies are somehow pushing the design aethetic that bigger wheels (or the look of bigger wheels) is what customers want, not just Stellantis - you see Range Rovers with ridiculously low-profile tyres for an off-road vehicle.
I don't think I'll bother swap the wheels on my e-208 GT. The car is good, it just feels different to the Leaf. The car has different quirks to the quirks that the Leaf has, that you and I got to know.
The test drive on a petrol 208GT will be subtly different from the electric one, because the electric version is heavier so handles slightly differently.
The 208's handling feels more go-kart like than the Leaf, partly due to the smaller steering wheel, and the wheels are nearer the corners. Reminds me a lot of my old 205 back in the day.",1,3184286

It seems that most car companies are somehow pushing the design aethetic that bigger wheels (or the look of bigger wheels) is what customers want, not just Stellantis - you see Range Rovers with ridiculously low-profile tyres for an off-road vehicle.
I don't think I'll bother swap the wheels on my e-208 GT. The car is good, it just feels different to the Leaf. The car has different quirks to the quirks that the Leaf has, that you and I got to know.
The test drive on a petrol 208GT will be subtly different from the electric one, because the electric version is heavier so handles slightly differently.
The 208's handling feels more go-kart like than the Leaf, partly due to the smaller steering wheel, and the wheels are nearer the corners. Reminds me a lot of my old 205 back in the day.

Thank you for your thoughts. We test drive a GT on Tuesday and then a Kona on Thursday. See how we get on. The e208 is so likeable and interior feels more welcoming than the Leaf.",0,3184733

I believe so. Not as stylish looking as the Peugeot e208. As far as I'm aware the 39 kWh model ok the Kona is very similar in price to the Peugeot e208. I'll see how I get along. The forum wisdom has been immensely helpful. Thank you.",0,3184901

That‚Äôs interesting as I actually spent more per month getting the e208 than a Kona was (on lease). I thought the Kona looked very boring but it is a bigger car with more range. I also picked it over a Kia e-Niro but judging by sales numbers that was a silly decision haha",0,3184901

The Mokka is equivalent to the e2008 and both are bigger and heavier than e208.

The Corsa-e is the equivalent Vauxhall to the e208 and below is a good comparison (used moniker is fairly irrelevant). As it says, a lot of people find the display on e208 difficult to see with sterling wheel in their preferred position which isn't an issue in the Corsa with more traditional layout. Do also look at the Corsa as you may find better deals.








Used electric cars: Peugeot e-208 vs Vauxhall Corsa-e


These two year-old small EVs share many components and, with compelling used prices, are desirable buys. However, which should you put on your driveway?




www.whatcar.com




That said, there are good deals on Mokka-e. This one requires you or relative to qualify for Partner, but it isn't hard. Don't dismiss PCP as the GFV is the attraction here - the chances of it being worth ¬£16K at 4 years old are definitely not guaranteed if you pay cash!

It is a left over from the early 24kWh LEAF. Charging a LEAF, especially the early ones, to 100% and letting it sit in hot weather will damage the battery. Plugging in any LEAF at or above 98% indicated will damage the battery. 

For a while, Nissan introduced a configurable 80% charge limit to stop this from happening. They even sent out a bulletin to dealers telling them to use the 80% setting. Nissan quietly dropped the setting around 2014. Newer generation batteries do better in hot weather and this is less of an issue now.

...Then of course, the reported state of charge from the battery pack is often artificially fudged so that what is reported as 100% is actually something more like 95%. Many vehicles do this, so that there's always some room for storing regen power, making the regen experience the same regardless of how full the battery pack is.

Click to expand...

You'd have to go downhill in B mode for about 100 miles to pack 5% back into the battery. The regen is useful and good but it in no way puts any serious amount of charge back into a 50kWh battery. The battery only needs less than 0.5% spare capacity to let regen work.",0,3182194

Nice! I really hope you get it then. No word yet from my Swedish dealer, but as long as I get it before end of March there's no problem for me, but at the beginning of April I will get rid of my current Petrol car so I will have no car if the new one is not ready.

Not a huge problem if it's a matter of a week or two, I still have motorcycles and it's warm enough in april, but it's much harder to get shopping done and those sorts of things. I also of course really want the e-208 now since it's my first EV ",1,3197986

I‚Äôm happy to say what I did on here.
I phone up Peugeot Uk customer services & just said that I felt it was unacceptable that my car was in the dealers compound for a week before they realised that it needed some work.
I asked for information of how the window switch recall & battery connector check was communicated to the dealer; was it sent via email or did they only find out about it when the went to carry out the pdi. Aparntly it is the latter 

I kept a cool head & just made my point that I really wasn‚Äôt happy with the communication from my dealer & the lack of communication that my dealer recieved from Peugeot about my (& the others awaiting the same work) car, highlighting again that I felt that if the dealer had recieved the communication prior to the pdi I would have had my car on the expected date.

Quoting myself here just to say that I'm a bit worried that they will just leave the car for along time and not get it charged.
I'm not sure how much the car will self de-charge in a couple of weeks, but I do not want it to go down to zero.

I told that to the dealer some week(s) ago, but his response was to not worry saying that ONE singele full decharge is no issue. I would disagree and say that any one full discharge can damage the battery pack, but my dealer is probably just stupid,used to petrol cars and has no idea what he's talking about.

In any case, I told him I do not want that to happen and told them to please charge it one in a while,but his mentality about it got me thinking that he does not give a fuck ",0,3196710

I told that to the dealer some week(s) ago, but his response was to not worry saying that ONE singele full decharge is no issue. I would disagree and say that any one full discharge can damage the battery pack, but my dealer is probably just stupid,used to petrol cars and has no idea what he's talking about.

In any case, I told him I do not want that to happen and told them to please charge it one in a while,but his mentality about it got me thinking that he does not give a fuck

If it provides any comfort - I just got back from 10 days away on vacation and my e208GT sat on the driveway unused for that entire time (not plugged in) and it was pretty much exactly the same charge level when I got back as when I left it. 

It was about half charged when I left and it was about half charged when I got back (obviously having no actual percentage display I can't say exactly what changed) - I don't think there's much (if any) degradation when not in use.",0,3200771

That's good to hear. I have seen videos of people parking Teslas and go away on vacation for a month and the battery is almost drained when they are back, but that might be because of all the electronics in a Tesla and their Sentry Mode that captures video.

Yeah it takes time as they needed to ship the part with the window switches back to the factory for fixing, then they will ship it back and the dealer assembly it again.
I talked to the dealer about it. They said that not all cars from the same batch has the exact same issue.

He talked about some gap/distance that they could measure that had to do with this. Not sure exactly what they mean, but something about this issue was measurable and if the distance for something was longer than X amount of mm, then the part had to be shipped back to factory. If the distance to whatever was acceptable, it could be sent to the customer without replacement.

Unfortunately, my car was one of less than half in the shipment that was affected enough to grant the recall.",0,3210234

Tax is not transferable any more. When you post off the V5 to the DVLA to tell them about the new owner they will cancel the tax (and issue a pro rata refund for the remaining time). However as your ion is electric, tax for the new owner won't cost anything, and you won't get a refund as there is nothing to refund

That first page of the battery report doesn't really show anything of interest. It's just the current voltages (and therefore state of balance) of only one of the cell modules in the car, not even the whole pack.

The main figure of interest in the battery report is the estimated Ah capacity, which will be a single number of around 35 - 46Ah. This gives a good indication of the state of health of the battery.

In theory a brand new battery was 46Ah usable capacity, so that would correspond to a SoH of 100%. Mine at 35k miles is currently sitting on around 39.5Ah or around 86% SoH, having dropped by around 0.5Ah in the 8000 miles since I bought it.",0,1567201

That page is just the report from one of the CMU's - I forget the exact numbers but there are about 12 of these ECU's each responsible for balancing and monitoring groups of 4 or 8 cells.

There is another overall BMS (battery management system) ECU which monitors the data from these and manages the entire battery pack as a whole including charge and discharge - the report from the main BMS is the one that includes the usable battery capacity in Ah.",0,1569289

There is no safety reason why it's unsafe to sit in the car whilst it's charging. Most cars will allow you to have the car switched on (albeit not the traction equipment obiously) with AC/heating etc. too.

Ha I don‚Äôt think so. Still learning on how it all works. Seem to be having some issues with the car so it‚Äôs booked to be looked over. Main concern is how quickly losing charge. Will mention the locking mechanism too.

It's possible the PSA BEVs heat the battery pack in cold weather. 

E.g VW ID.3 does this, if the battery is <13C I think, and it takes a chunk of energy to do this! Had an ID.3 briefly, and a short trip of a mile to shops & back last winter would see me getting around 2 to 2.5 miles/kWh! I didn't keep this car very long, lots of things I didn't like about it & I much preferred the Ioniq 38 I was planning to sell on. The same trip, same temps, in Ioniq would see me getting my usual 4.7 m/kWh. Big difference is the Hyundai/Kias don't bother preheating the battery at start of a cold trip. Maybe that's worse for the battery, who knows? But I'm generally driving around using 20-30 kW power, and the motor's rated 100 kW, so I don't think the battery gets stressed by my gentle driving. I believe VW have had a lot of complaints about this power-hogging, and something's getting changed in the s'ware to fix/ameliorate this issue.

All I can say about your figures is that the figures you're seeing are atrocious. My GOM in cold weather with 100% SOC and 38.4 kWh usable (probably 41 or 42-ish total?) will show me 170 mile range. And if I drive around a bit, the range drops in line with the miles I've done. I simply do not see sudden losses of 20 miles, and I don't see why you should either.

Ioniq 28 & 38 are the most efficient BEVs around, along with Model 3. Looks like PSA have a lot of catching up to do!",0,3198053

Original Brochure car SJ60 WKY.
Allied Electric.
Range 60 miles
Mileage 18K

Currently at 57% battery and stopped charging. At 67% it was running and stopped when it hit 57%?
Cells removed and all read 3.32v one read 3.28v. After putting back together 10 months ago and not knowing how to fix, I lost interest.
Spare charger unit included as replacing this did not solve the problem.
I used it daily for 18 months and the only issue was the 12v battery, so I always kept a spare in the back.
Small mark on the corner of the bonnet and panel bump on the boot (see pic beside the pin on the green plug)
I do have the original brochure and this will be included with the vehicle.

Media system keeps switching off. If I attempt to use the audio system when the car is switched on but NOT in the Ready condition, the media screen shuts down within a few seconds with the message ' energy economy mode activated'. I don't remember it doing this when we first got the car, e-208 GT Oct. 2020. I've read the manual and if you have run the car for 30 minutes then you should get up to 40 minutes of audio etc. before this energy economy mode kicks in. I have tested the battery after the journey and it shows 12.6 volts which I would imagine is enough to both start the car or run the media system. Despite this if I turn off the car and then restart in non-ready mode the audio turns off within a few seconds. So can anyone suggest what might be going on here. Is there a setting I have inadvertently changed, or does it look like a trip to the dealer. Thanks.

My does the same, after a while it disconnects the traction battery and starts using the 12V battery. This triggers the energy economy mode after some time using it.

Click to expand...

50kwh is still in the realms of being a pain in the backside for most people. It's only really usable as a normal car if there is infrastructure and if it's not blocked/broken. The majority of people simply won't put up with not knowing if they can get a charge to get home and if it will take an extra few hours in a queue of ev's. 
If it's an only car it can't do the long distance stuff most people do now and then without charging on route. Same goes for the days when there is a lot to do and it needs charging inbetween. New baby? That will mean the heater and for peace of mind will pretty much limit most owners to 80 miles - again not something people will always be doing but if it can't it becomes useless as a main car or a complete pain in the bum. 
Considering the batteries we're already getting in things like the new i3, I would say 100+kWh is not going to be long around the corner. At 50 it's just another range limited ev to a lot of people.",0,295454

These sentences summarise the issues raised in this forum daily. But they also highlight the extreme edge of EV ownership. I take issue with the words - 'majority of people' and ' most people' that are used. 

In actual fact the 'majority of people' use an ICE well within the normal range of an EV almost all of the time. This happens to be a fact revealed by every survey and study on the subject. So the subject of being stranded unable to get home from work, or sat in a huge queue for hours is to grossly exaggerate the issue. Its a problem perceived rather than real.

Also, there are an enormous number of people out there who simply don't do the long distance stuff referred to - certainly not the 'most people' claimed. They buy small engined ICE cars that are used for short commutes and local domestic trips and rarely even take those further than a 60 mile round trip. That is ideal EV territory and with a real world range of even 150 miles would be sufficient for a huge number of drivers. Such drivers would never even consider taking their tiny Aygo, for instance, on a 250 mile journey. The fact that they could do that is another red herring. They don't. 

I happen to think that it will be some time before that penny drops with enough people to make serious inroads into total EV ownership. Meanwhile, cars such as the i3 should be encouraged. They offer that fig leaf of extra range to the timid. Of course lots of buyers of an i3 have bought after a carefully thought out decision based on their particular driving needs, and use its rex to carry out that plan. Others just like the safety net but never use it. 

But to maintain that 'most people' couldn't cope with an EV with the range suggested in this article, for 95% of their driving, is simply wrong. They might think that is the case but that doesn't make them right.",5,295470

The problem is the difference between perception and reality. I know a number of people that are terrified of ""falling out"" of a lift that has glass sides and even one that is terrified of falling out of a plane window. It's not something that could happen, but their fears are strong. When you have grown up being driven in or driving vehicles that can go 400 or more miles before needing to stop, and refuel in 5 minutes, you can easily fall prey to the fossil-industry's favourite fear-tactic of range-anxiety. If humans could easily think clearly and rationally there would hardly be any new ICE cars being bought. But if people could think this way the whole gambling industry would also collapse and look how well that does!",2,295502

Name: Unnamed: 0, dtype: int64",4893,"May 27, 2016","But that's just the problem. If it's an only car it's not good enough that it's fine most of the time or 95% of the time. For instance an i-miev would be great for commuting for most people but falls flat on it's face when you ask it to do the weekly trip to see the inlaws. 
More range helps but even a 150 mile range will only be good enough for most people most of the time. 
If they were cheap enough to be second cars they would sell by the million but we're talking about a fairly expensive purchase which can then only do the job most of the time. 
This is why things like the i3 rex outsells the bev 2:1 even though it has a slightly lower ev range, slower acceleration and so on. 
It may not be very often but the one or two times you need to do more than it's capable of, a battery car then becomes as useful as a chocolate teacosy - as would an ice if you needed to drive 10 miles more than it's full tank range and the only filling station was out of juice. 
It's not a charging problem or an ev problem - it's a battery capacity problem. This is why Tesla started by sticking in massive packs - they realised that if you don't have spare capacity it not only becomes much less convenient and useful much more quickly but also pushes the smaller battery much closer to it's upper and lower edges much more easily. 

As it stands Teslas seem to still be the only pure ev genuinely capable of replacing an ice in almost every situation - partly from having a large capacity and partly because the supercharger network tends not to be jammed up with phev's. 
All the studies in the world saying an average use is x,y,z make no difference if it can't go the extra bit when needed. 
I think it was about 36 miles a day average from memory (could be wrong) but that's completely irrelevant when you want to go past it. 

I have quite an unusual usage pattern which means all bevs but Teslas at the moment would be useless to me. A genuine 150 mile in any weather one would actually suit me very well and 50/60kWh seems to put it in that area so this may be fine for my use. 
That is as a second car but the mileage I do would be enough for the cheaper running costs to offset the initial expense in a relatively short time. 
Again I'm not a normal user but it would still be something I wouldn't consider taking distance with the kids - especially in certain areas - because having one charger out could be the difference between being fine and a flatbed - not something I would want with a 2 year old, 5 year old and 6 year old. For peace of mind in a 150 mile car I would want to see a charger for a top up every 70 miles or so. 
A Tesla 90 would almost always have plenty to get either where it's going or to another charger which makes the difference and this is the point. 
Even low range ev's that we have at the moment cover the day to day for the majority but can't take the place of an only car because the usual day to day isn't all it gets used for.

That's the crux though. It may be rarely used but rarely used is still used. Fitting a 50l rather than a 10l tank may not cost a lot more but it does have implications in a small car for load and passenger space and in certain cases safety.

Imagination? initiative?
Technology is there to make our lives easier. A family of 5 isn't going to want to use the public transport network to go on holiday not only because it takes MUCH longer, but also because it's stressful enough herding 3 kids without having to do it with a dozen changes and waits in a journey. Not everyone has the money to hire a decent sized car as a temporary stop gap for the holiday... and what about if it isn't a holiday? what about when the long journey is sprung on you last minute? no time to organise a hire car just need to jump in the car and go. is it common? no. does it happen? yes.

A car is not a cheap investment, and it shouldn't be a compromise. why should someone have to use imagination or initiative, or creativity, or outside the box thinking, or just suck it up when they don't need to?

And yes, there are people that do it already, there are people that do it regularly... and they have my utmost respect. I do not have that much patience, and I wouldn't want to put my 4 year old through that many half hour stops.

sorry to disappoint you, but that's just the way life is. is it ideal? not at all... but there are times that life is incompatible with the ideal... life is inherently unfair. Like it or not, the majority of BEV's and the current charging network just isn't sufficient for 'normal' drivers to accept. it isn't about education, it's about tech doing it's job. Tech fits us, not the other way round! people are inherently lazy and want the shortest route to their goals... the current BEV's are not anywhere near that yet, they are getting there slowly, but they are not there yet!
To be honest, we shouldn't expect them to be there yet either. let's not kid ourselves, the current EV tech is in it's infancy!

Agreed. And if you had made those points before I would have agreed then. But you cited a case of someone going out of range, and back, once a year. 

It's a complicated equation to consider for sure. Lack of finance is a poor argument though. Saving thousands a year on 95% of journeys and then spending a few hundred on a hire car doesn't seem too hard to conclude as making financial sense. Last minute trips of hundreds of miles are vanishingly rare. Usually involving emotional family events and much better served by public transport than driving with your mind elsewhere on such issues.

What you are doing is rehash the reasons why hybrids and such outsell pure BEVs. Even then I suspect that if everyone kept a strict log of a years actual experience with any car, including an ICE, they would find that the number of times that a BEV couldn't have coped perfectly satisfactorily is probably nearer to 1% then the much quoted 5%. And that a perfectly satisfactory alternative could have been used for those few trips.",1,296122

OK. A few points. This started off by a discussion about your contention that drivers wanted to own a car that would be suitable for all possible journeys. You then went on to admit that such a car would only be needed for a few days a year. When it is pointed out that saving thousands of pounds on fuel by owning a BEV, and then recycling some of that money to cover the few days you mention by alternative transport I get accused of being somehow insensitive to people incapable of working that out themselves. 

I went on to say that I agreed with your own opinion about it not being a simple equation but then get accused of being naive. This is getting quite bizarre. 

We all know that a BEV isn't suitable for everyone. But there are more people who it would be suitable for if they took the time to look deeper.

The point has been made very well by @MoonCat who shows that the seemingly impossible feat of stepping outside the box to adapt your transport to something best suited for each journey can in fact make a lot of financial and practical sense.

Nissan addressed the problem years ago by offering a two week free hire of an ICE as a powerful selling point for the Leaf in order to point out this obvious method of having ones cake and eating it. Without opening up the debate about how difficult this is to achieve due to dealer resistance the point is still there. Savings made on EV fuel can easily be recycled to do that for any suitable ICE of your choice for a specific task.

There are only perhaps 2 or 3 people on this forum who have any experience with repair and troubleshooting of these specific cars - and they are also on the myimev forum. So to be honest you're much more likely to get help on myimev as this forum while being UK centric is 95% EV drivers and maybe 5% DIY'ers while myimev forum members are heavily DIY oriented people who like to get their hands dirty troubleshooting and repairing and that forum is the best resource I've found online for getting help repairing these cars.

Back in February I had to repair the onboard charger in my 2011 Ion - it had the classic 20 amp fuse in the MCU and two disc capacitors in the onboard charger failure that stopped it charging either the traction battery or the 12v battery. I was able to do this myself relatively easily thanks to the help on myimiev (having an electronics background helps too...) and I was actually forewarned of the problem before it happened to me so as soon as it did happen I was quickly able to diagnose it and knew immediately what it was likely to be and ordered the parts before I even opened it up...

I'm not that far from you (Motherwell) but I don't have any experience of the P1A15 fault apart from casual reading in myimiev a few months ago, and well, coronavirus... 

One of the potential causes of P1A15 from what I remember is a faulty pre-charge resistor, however this is located inside the traction battery housing so you'd have to drop and dismantle the traction battery to get at it even to test it. I've had my traction battery out to swap some cells (and took a bunch of photos of the process) and @G.a.r.y has worked on some as well so there is at least that. I'm not entirely sure where in the traction battery assembly the resistor is though as I didn't go looking for it. A faulty air con compressor or PTC heater putting a partial short on the HV bus could potentially also cause P1A15 so it might be worth unplugging them (the two orange cables at the front of the pack) as a quick test to see if the car will then go into READY. (Be careful of the high voltages of course, 360v DC is deadly as you can't let go if you grab it like you can with AC, it's much more dangerous than a 240v AC shock)

I wish you well though and I'm sure with help from the guys on myimiev you have at least a fighting chance of fixing it. After an onboard charger failure in February and a brake vacuum pump failure in June I decided enough was enough and traded mine in on a much younger Leaf as I already have an old Petrol car to exercise my DIY skills.

I second everything that DBMandrake has written.
Is the error on the car constant or intermittent? Does the same error code return after clearing every time you try to start the car, or is it intermittent? Do you see any other error codes? Is the capacitor voltage always reported as 2 volts? This very low voltage implies that there's no attempt at charging the cap - maybe the EVECU is not pulling in the pre-charge Contactor.
Do you have high-voltage experience, tools, test equipment and PPE to safely work on this problem?
I doubt that you would find general electronics companies that could test the boards removed from the vehicle. Some of the components on the boards can be tested statically with a multimeter, but I think you first need to progress in localising the fault.",0,None

Had heard that the heater and AC units can cause a problem, so I think they would be worth investigation, even just to rule them out. 

The oracle that is Kiev seemed to be pointing towards some failed components in the bottom PCB, hence my interest in getting these tested. Seems to be a similar issue to that which affects the DC-DC converter, i.e. failed 50p capacitors etc.

The error is permanent. I've never been able to get the car to go into 'Ready'. If I reset the error code (and I'm quick), I have been able to hear (what I think are) the contactors working. The error generally comes back before I have the opportunity to hear this though.

I've only tested the capacitor voltage once, using Hobdrive. I've read that it's a good idea to measure this with a multimeter and compare the two values. Not 100% where I would be measuring about though.

I've never worked on HV before, but my pair of the Class 0 gloves arrived in the post today, so figured I should be pretty well protected with those and some safety specs. Plan of action would be, disconnect 12v. Wait 5 mins. Pull plug under passenger seat. Disconnect heater/AC. Reconnect plug, then 12v. Test again. If unsuccessful, repeat previous procedure, add in a little extra waiting time to allow big cap to discharge, then remove inverter for closer inspection.

With an old-fashioned analogue meter set to Ohms you can confirm that the 800uF 450v input filter capacitor in the motor inverter will accept a charge. The meter pointer will initially swing to the right indicating low resistance, then drop back as the capacitor charges ( to the voltage of the meter's internal battery ). You will have to temporarily disconnect one terminal of the capacitor ( which is polarised ) to test it. Note that when an analogue meter is set to Ohms, the black test lead is actually positive.
If you plan to do a dynamic test by measuring the actual voltage across the capacitor as ( or if ) it charges, then again an analogue meter may indicate this faster ( as long as the meter has a 500v DC range and adequate insulation ).
I still suspect that the capacitor is not even attempting to charge, because a Contactor is not closing ( or not conducting ). You can monitor the 12v control signals for the negative, the precharge, and the positive Contactors at connector C-111 of the EV-ECU, under the rear seat. The +12v signal for the negative contactor is pin 106 ( violet ), precharge is 105 ( yellow ), positive is 107 ( red ). Ground is pin 10 ( black ) on connector C-106.
Before each test, clear the fault code and then try to power-up whilst monitoring the contactor drive signal. It may be helpful to rig a 12v LED indicator to each of the 3 signals to be able to see a pulse.",0,None

Unfortunately, I'm currently self isolating, so it'll be Sunday at the earliest before I get a chance to put it into practice.

I have an old avometer, which sounds like it might be more useful for the tests you've described. I don't have it handy at the moment to check the specs- hopefully it will be up to the job.

I'm guessing a led is preferred to a 12v test bulb as the signal is on for too short a time to allow the bulb to illuminate?

Also is there a sequence that these pins should follow during start-up? Or as long as all get power during start-up that's ok?

For the static test on the capacitor, the straight Ohms range will do ( check that the internal 1.5v battery is OK ). To measure the cap charging, use the 500v DC range. Clipping the test leads on permanently, rather than holding them, would be safer.
However, I would first confirm that the 12v contactors are being activated. In normal operation the negative contactor should pull in and stay on, then the precharge should pulse ( a second or two ? ) and drop out, whilst the positive comes on and stays on.However, with this fault condition, the exact sequence will depend on how quickly the P1A15 error causes all the contactors to drop out.

It would be possible to place the three wire-ended LEDs nearer to the driver's seat by extending their leads. I think 5 or 6 feet is possible, by using 3 lengths of twisted-pair flex, with each signal wire ( pins 105, 106, 107 ) paired with a grounded wire ( pin 10 ).
To piggy-back these test leads to the pins at connector C-111 of the EV-ECU, I would be tempted to push a needle through the wires.

If this troubleshooting process does not yield any clues, I think it could be repeated using an oscilloscope to check for and get precise timings of the contactor drive signals, whilst monitoring the voltage rise on the capacitor.
Another idea would be to positively drive the contactors in the required sequence, using external 12v supplies, instead of the EV-ECU signals.",0,None

Results were as follows-
Voltage over the big capacitor was 350v. This only lasted for a split second, before reducing to 0v. The cap only charged up on occasions when I could hear the contactors operating. Occasions when the contactors operated were few and far between. I think this was because a DTC (u1113- related to CANBUS) kept appearing even before I'd tried to start. The p1a15 error didn't generally seem to appear every time, but I'm pretty sure it did after I'd heard the contactors activating.

I also monitored the EV ECU pins as suggested. 105 and 106 were definitely working (albeit only when the contactors could be heard). 107 didn't appear to be doing anything, but this could've been due to a bad contact with the test led. I plan to have another go tomorrow and see if I can get 12v on pin 107.

Seems a little odd to me that the u1113 error seems to be so persistent. My initial thoughts had been that this was symptomatic of the p1a15 dtc, but since they don't seem to always appear together, I'm really not sure now!",0,None

I then checked the connections of the test leds and monitored the pulses. 105 and 106 can be seen to come on and off, although 107 (the positive contactor doesn't produce a signal).

Didn't get a very accurate reading with the Avometer due to the needle dropping away pretty quickly, but I'm thinking that the voltage I measured over the cap was actually 358v (rather than my earlier estimation of 350v).

Now thinking that the issue may be to do with the voltage measuring circuit in the inverter being defective. So, although the capacitor is charging up to battery voltage, the ev ECU is seeing that the capacitor voltage isn't charging fully. Think this is what's causing the p1a15 code to be thrown.

The measured brief 350v or 358v across the capacitor is correct. Perhaps that voltage is via the precharge contactor, maybe the issue is due to the main ( positive ) contactor not closing or not conducting? Obviously not easy to read an analogue meter quickly enough, but then again the sampling rate of a DVM means they are slow too.

The U1113 CANbus errors - perhaps bad connections, maybe some connectors or modules were disconnected and removed then re-installed during troubleshooting before you got the car.

From your video, it looks like there is a brief flash on 105 (PRE) ( probably not a fault? ), then 106 (NEG) comes on, followed by a good steady pulse on 105 (PRE), finally 106 (NEG) drops out.
Nothing on 107 -POS- could be the output driver of the EV-ECU for that signal failing, or the ECU decides not to enable POS because it thinks the voltage on the capacitor is not high enough or not rising fast enough. Does that decision already get made during precharge......?

Normally there are multiple clacks, (negative contactor and pre-charge contactor, then a delay, then pre-charge contactor dropping out and positive contactor engaging) are you sure you're not hearing any at all? That would suggest quite a different problem of the ECU not even pulling in the contactors at all.

Have you tried disconnecting the HV cables to the PTC heater and A/C compressor as a quick test to rule out an insulation breakdown or fault in those? These are the two connectors at the front of the battery pack separate from the cable going to the MCU, and you only need the underbelly plastic covers off to get at them.

P1A15 means the high voltage (measured at the MCU I think) failed to rise to the expected voltage within the expected time period of a few hundred milliseconds during pre-charge.

There are many possible causes for that including -

1) Contactor didn't close at all due to the 12v feed to the contactors not being applied. If you really don't hear any clicks this could be your situation, in which case start tracing the control signals from the ECU. (Are the i-Miev circuit diagrams adequate for this?)

2) Burnt contactor contacts or faulty pre-charge resistor. (Both inside the battery pack)

3) A parasitic load on the HV voltage lines beyond the contactors - this could be in the PTC heater, A/C compressor, MCU or OBC. The PTC heater and A/C compressor can be isolated as above, and it's also possible to isolate the OBC DC/DC converter by removing the 20 amp fuse in the MCU inspection hatch at the top. It wouldn't take much load for the pre-charge resistor and parasitic load to form a voltage divider which prevents the target voltage being attained during pre-charge.

4) A fault with voltage sensing in the MCU, where it detects a lower than true voltage. We've seen a couple of examples of this on my-imev.com and there is suspicion that the voltage divider resistors may be drifting in value. I think one person padded the top divider resistor with a high value and managed to resolve their issue that way.",0,2957675

In the process of eliminating the many possible causes, I'm going to energise each of the 3 main traction battery pack contactors individually NOT in sequence to confirm that the 3 contactors (negative, precharge and main positive) are not faulty and that the pre-charge resistor is not open circuit.

Hi where did you solder the resistor? I couldnt seem to open your picture. Seems to prove it is the voltage divider that is failing although having the variable resistor seems like an ongoing inconvenience. Is the voltage divider replaceable with one from a dead car or is it part of a larger component?

Which caps are we talking about? Tiny surface mount ones in the picture above? Are they going leaky upsetting the accuracy of the voltage divider? Seems like an odd failure mode for a ceramic chip capacitor.

Regarding trimming the voltage divider - it looks like Hobdrive has the ability to show the voltage measured by the BMS, (summed voltage of all cells from the CMU boards) and the voltage across the main filter cap in the MCU, (suspect voltage measuring circuit discussed here) in which case it should be possible to trim the divider so the two accurately match.

Currently with the extra resistor the voltage reading from the MCU is significantly higher than that reported by the BMS - this is probably going to set off alarm bells in the ECU...",1,2959392

Inspired by this thread, I recently acquired a non-running C-Zero with the P1A15 error. Along with it came a written-off iOn as a ""spares"" car. The C-Zero is ex-Edinburgh Police. It developed the fault before having it's first MOT, i.e. over 5 years ago, and despite the involvement of Mitsubishi Japan it has never been fixed. I am looking forward to the challenge!

Although it is most likely that the ground fault and leakage detected errors are caused by the measured voltage divergence, are you sure that all connections and board mountings for the refitted inverter boards are secure?
Regarding the 5Meg trimpot: I would suggest mounting it close to the chip ( where the 2M fixed resistor was ), but epoxy a piece of semi-stiff plastic tube ( e.g. the ink tube from a BIC ballpoint ) to the adjuster and lead it out through a small hole drilled in the side of the inverter enclosure.",0,2957611

Normally there are multiple clacks, (negative contactor and pre-charge contactor, then a delay, then pre-charge contactor dropping out and positive contactor engaging) are you sure you're not hearing any at all? That would suggest quite a different problem of the ECU not even pulling in the contactors at all.

Have you tried disconnecting the HV cables to the PTC heater and A/C compressor as a quick test to rule out an insulation breakdown or fault in those? These are the two connectors at the front of the battery pack separate from the cable going to the MCU, and you only need the underbelly plastic covers off to get at them.

P1A15 means the high voltage (measured at the MCU I think) failed to rise to the expected voltage within the expected time period of a few hundred milliseconds during pre-charge.

There are many possible causes for that including -

1) Contactor didn't close at all due to the 12v feed to the contactors not being applied. If you really don't hear any clicks this could be your situation, in which case start tracing the control signals from the ECU. (Are the i-Miev circuit diagrams adequate for this?)

2) Burnt contactor contacts or faulty pre-charge resistor. (Both inside the battery pack)

3) A parasitic load on the HV voltage lines beyond the contactors - this could be in the PTC heater, A/C compressor, MCU or OBC. The PTC heater and A/C compressor can be isolated as above, and it's also possible to isolate the OBC DC/DC converter by removing the 20 amp fuse in the MCU inspection hatch at the top. It wouldn't take much load for the pre-charge resistor and parasitic load to form a voltage divider which prevents the target voltage being attained during pre-charge.

4) A fault with voltage sensing in the MCU, where it detects a lower than true voltage. We've seen a couple of examples of this on my-imev.com and there is suspicion that the voltage divider resistors may be drifting in value. I think one person padded the top divider resistor with a high value and managed to resolve their issue that way.

Click to expand...

OK, back to basis for me. I connected an external battery, bolted large good battery straps.

Connected up a 2 channel scope. 
Channel A connected to the +terminal of the 12v battery
Channel B connected to the EV-ECU ignition switched supply (light blue wire pin 3 - 36V connector)

Battery voltage started out at 12.1 volts with ignition on (its cold out there). It had been charged 4 hours previously.

Transient voltage at 50ms sampling time was 11.84v on channel A, 10.73v on channel B

Thats a 1.1v drop at say 5amps???? that would make it 0.2ohms resistance in the circuit (all the connections plus small gauge wiring. Seem excessive?
Secondly, with the voltage on the switched supply to the EV-ECU going this low, could it lead to false measurements of the charging condensor (time or voltage) back at the MCU? Has anyone got any comparative data?

The discussion about the fault being caused by an over-saturated transformer core that has become permanently magnetized, and which could be fixed by demagnetisation, makes no sense at all. There are transformers on the hybrid daughter-board, perhaps for voltage isolation, but they are pulse transformers with ferrite cores, and this highly permeable material has negligible remanence.

The AD8677 Op-Amp used in the hybrid circuit is already a device with ultra-low offset, ( i.e. it knows when the two inputs really are equal ), and this offset is stable against variations in temperature and time ( i.e. ageing ). Rather than the ""MyImiev Forum solution"" of trimming the input voltage divider to alter the ratio of measured voltage vs. reference voltage, this new solution biases the output of the Op-Amp by using a 20k variable resistor to offset ( skew ) the pre-existing internal balance in the chip between the two inputs.

Your scope has confirmed what the fault code suggests - negative and pre-charge contactors are being powered however the ECU is not happy with the voltage across the capacitor being correct within the specified amount of time so aborts instead of engaging the positive contactor.

Is it possible for you to put the scope on the HV out of the battery pack ? You could measure this on the 20 amp fuse inside the MCU inspection hatch, or at one of the cables for the heater or A/C compressor.

Be aware that the HV system is fully isolated from the ground of the car - you cannot connect your scope ground to both the 12v ground and HV negative at the same time as you will cause the HV system to fail the isolation test when it checks the insulation resistance between the HV system and normal electrical system. The entire HV system including battery, motor, inverter etc ""floats"" relative to the chassis with opto isolators / transformers etc being the only connection between the two systems. (Even the CMU's in the battery pack use opto-isolators for the can bus signals)

You could connect a battery powered scope (I assume yours is?) to the HV negative and MCU fuse (or just across the PTC heater plug) and use a simple opto-isolator circuit to connect another channel to the pre-charge contactor relay coil if you want to look at the relative timing of the contactor and HV voltage rise although I'm not sure the relative timing is that important - the HV voltage rise curve alone is probably all the info you need.

It would be very interesting to look at the HV voltage charge curve on a storage scope - how high does the voltage go, (relative to actual battery voltage) how long does it take to get there, and indeed does it rise at all! This would help confirm or rule out a number of possibilities.",0,None

Yes the scope I'm using is portable so floating wrt to true earth. If I remove the lid of the MCU (later design of MCU so possibly doesn't have an inspection hatch) I can use the 20A fuse to measure precharge positive voltage rise (time and amplitude). Not sure where I will pick up the negative side of the traction pack within the MCU. Using a 10:1 probe will presumably enhance safety whilst making the measurements.
Since the scope only has a single earth reference to cover both channels, it would be inadvisable to make a simultaneous measurement of the 12v coil driver output????
To measure the traction pack voltage directly (as alternative to Canion, Diagbox or HOBDRIVE) I guess the Chademo port is the best access point (but would need a hack to energise). All suggestions most welcome.

From memory the Battery HV negative is also available within reach of a probe through the MCU inspection hatch as the hatch covers where the 5 HV cables come into the upper compartment of the MCU. I'm sure your later version will still have the hatch - without the hatch you wouldn't be able to disconnect the cables before removing the MCU.

Or if you measure at the PTC heater plug then you have +/- directly available on the plug. (But that would require the car up on ramps and removal of the plastic under covers so not as convenient!)

Like I said, you can't do this as the HV and 12v/chassis electrical systems must remain isolated or it will at the very least trigger a fault condition that will shut down the HV system, worst case you zap your scope...

I'd just measure the high voltage charge up ramp - that should give the info needed.

I don't like the sound of that hack. I would say that Diagbox/Canion/Hobdrive would be sufficiently accurate to measure the battery side of the contactors, so as a first pass I would try that. They are able to report the traction battery voltage with the key turned on before attempting to go into ready mode.

It sounds like you think I'm suggesting you remove the entire MCU top cover - I'm not, just the small cable termination cover near the front edge of the top of the box - it's about 10cm x 5cm in size, held on by just a few small bolts with a re-usable gasket. I have photos somewhere but I'd have to dig them up. I'd probably pull the safety plug first in case you drop a bolt inside and then put the plug back in just before you're ready to take the measurement.

Then It got a bit complicated. After removing the 200A fuse to the OBC, I got a ready. Measured voltage on the scope within 2volts of HOBDRIVE.

So MCU measurements must be OK

Click to expand...

If the voltage reported by Hobdrive agrees with the scope I think we can rule out a measurement error in the MCU.

Assuming you're looking at the right figure in Hobdrive - Hobdrive can report both the MCU reported voltage across the MCU capacitor and also the BMS reported voltage inside the battery pack which I think is just the sum of the CMU reported voltages from each cell bank. Both of course should read the same when the contactors are engaged.

One question though - 220 volts is way too low - for an 80 cell car that's only 2.75 volts per cell. That can't possibly be right??

Full charge is 4.1 volts per cell, 4.1 x 80 = 328 volts. Fully discharged is about 3.6 volts per cell, so 3.6 x 80 = 288 volts. 220 volts would be low enough to set fault codes.

Looking up P1A15 I note the following:



Code No. P1A15: High-voltage system error (1)

Bit of a coincidence that 220v is the threshold where a fault code will be set ?? Could it be right on the edge of triggering the fault?

Also, the picture you posted doesn't show the rise time, it looks like a near vertical line. Can you expand the time base a lot so that the rise time is stretched across most of the screen so I can see the shape of the curve?",0,2969260

Sorry, for my poor reporting. 220v is a failed READY, reported value from HOBDRIVE and scope, both are very close. Pack is about 50%SOC, about 314V.

With the 20A fuse removed, the reported Voltage rise and measured scope voltage rise was 166V. This might just be a random fluctuation.

The interesting aspect is that I'm getting a lot of "" no response"" when turning the key to start. Nothing, no clacks, HV warning light. Turning the ignition key to the off position and trying again seems to work on maybe 2nd, 3rd, even 4th try.

I havent tested this but I don't think the MCU needs to charge to full pack voltage, just enough to prevent arcing on the main + contactor. It could charge the capacitor to half pack voltage then bring in the main contactor if the capacitor has charged sufficiently? Otherwise there might be a slightly-too-long delay when starting the car perhaps? As I say this isnt tested and is just a theory but maybe we shouldnt expect to see full pack voltage from precharge. Someone who wanted to test this could disconnect the main + contactor and see what voltage you get in the MCU. Would be a bit of a faff to test but would be interesting.

The time for the 800uF capacitor in the motor inverter to charge to the required voltage will be monitored by software running in the microprocessor of the EV-ECU.

Agree that the EV-ECU or whatever alternate name PSA used is the master controller and communicates with the MCU ( aka inverter) wrt voltage rise.
I found, via scope readings, that the charging time cut out after 20msecs so not a voltage measurement problem at all. I would suggest careful and repeated measurements as this fault code has numerous causes which cannot be linked back to a single issueüòÄ",0,3002315

In my opinion the P1A15 codes are false ( invalid ) errors.

I've read the forum and there seem to be several of you local to Scotland.
At the moment it's stuck in a university car park. Is there any chance any you would be willing to come and give me a hand (at least read the code)? Happy to pay for your time/travel costs/treat you to a nice curry.

Hi,

Sorry to hear you are suffering with P1A15 as well ! You can sometimes clear the code and get the car running but often it just fails again when you try to restart so its not a guarantee - might at least get the car home tho.

There is currently a battery replacement option in Australia but tbh the cost just doesnt make it worthwhile - you could buy a different EV for the value of the car and cost of the replacement battery ! At the end of the day they are still very basic cars with power hungry heaters.

What is the general condition of the car? How is it underneath with rust, particularly round the back? I've bought mievs from Scotland before and got them working, one was from a college car park in Edinburgh a few years ago ! Currently fixing a miev and an ion

Terrible idea, its forcing the check to go through when there may be a major issue. Encouraging people to bodge their cars that could have other issues. What if the heater or AC is failing and thats pulling down the precharge voltage instead? May also be unreliable as you are increasing the voltage reading by a fixed amount and I've seen cars damaged by people attempting this repair when this wasn't the fault the car had - just because they watch someone do it on youtube and have a go, and you then have to fix a car with the original fault and damage on the MCU board. This board has high voltage on it and could kill someone !

There is a proper fix for this issue which is to replace the hybrid board with a new isolation amplifier chip which sits on a new custom printed circuit board. This fix is available through Hevra garages in the UK.

Don't get me wrong Dala, you do some great stuff but this one is a terrible idea, encourages people to bodge their cars when there could be a more serious issue and they could kill themselves in the process...",0,3357337

I don't know whether the voltage test is done once at the beginning of charging, or whether the voltage rising to 247 volts would abort a charge that has already been in progress for a while...

If the latter that is very concerning when you might come out in the morning to find the car stopped charging due to a night time voltage peak! 

Click to expand...

I think I have the answer to my own question - I noticed from my loop monitor that the car appeared to have stopped charging sooner than I thought it should have.

I went out and checked and sure enough it had stopped charging at 15 out of 16 bars.  (which it has never done before) Mains voltage was 247 volts again. I disconnected it and plugged it back in again and it is charging, mains at 246 volts, but for how long...

So yes, apparently if the voltage gets ""too high"" during charging it will abort the charging process. This is very bad news indeed because now I can never completely trust the car to be fully charged in the mornings, at least unless mains voltages come back down to ""normal"" levels again. 

The problem is the voltage is still within the UK tolerances so the power company aren't going to be interested in any complaint I might have, and I can't see Peugeot doing anything either. So if voltages don't come back down I am kinda screwed as I can't ensure that the car will charge to 100% without constant nannying.",0,None

All I have to say about it is that you've done an excellent job researching the causes and taking notes of the issues, you seem to have the answer well-proven already! 

If you want to take this further now, then you need to discuss this with your supplier and Peugeot, though I don't think you will get very far.

Certainly it is 'unfit for purpose' if it cannot charge on legally supplied mains. Looks like you will need to keep your 2kW fan heater nearby and be ready to make use of it every so often to pull your voltage down.

The only other thing that springs to mind is (contrary to all good advice, but this is 'adversity') get yourself a long extension lead and use that with your granny.

I noticed on Gridwatch both last night and today that the grid frequency is consistently on the high side instead of fluctuating either side of 50Hz as it should which suggests that they are deliberately over generating. The coal plants have also seemingly been running at full power since at least yesterday which is also unusual, but possibly because they're trying to save gas due to a potential ""gas shortage"" that was reported yesterday... (CCGT output is a lot lower than usual)

So I think the national grid control room are having a difficult time the last few days and one side effect is less closely controlled voltage!

I think you're right - although the car is at fault for rejecting valid UK voltage I think I'd be between a rock and a hard place with the DNO and Peugeot, I doubt either one would do anything, especially when the car isn't even made by Peugeot - their ability to do anything about a design problem is probably nill.

I'll have a quick check on Diagbox later to see if there are any region configuration options for the OBC although I don't recall having seen anything of interest when I've poked around before.

The problem with the long extension lead suggestion is that there is no voltage drop before the car starts drawing power - so the initial voltage is still too high for it to start charging, it would only help once it was already charging.

Also the Ion has a charging characteristic where if you start charging from a low percentage - about 25% or less, it charges for a while, then ""pauses"" for up to 20 minutes where the charge point is still active but power draw drops to about 20 watts before resuming. (I'm guessing it is doing some sort of cell balancing) When this happened the voltage drop across the extension would go away again and the rise in mains voltage would trigger it to cut out again.

I don't know how the supply and demand works for the UK gas supply, was it ever really a true shortage or was it just a ""if it keeps up like this we'll have to phone the Russians and pay a lot more for extra gas"" ?

If the 12v battery voltage could affect the sensitivity threshold for mains voltage it would be a very very poor and shoddy design indeed. I'd rate that as exceptionally unlikely. The electronics that measure the mains voltage are going to themselves be run from regulated supply rails. It's not rocket science.



Tolerance is supposedly 230v + 10% and -6% so if measured voltage is within that then it's the car being intolerant not the supply being a problem.

Click to expand...

Yes the car design is at fault as far as I can see. It's probably made with the EU market and their lower average voltage supply in mind and nobody gave it a second thought when the car was brought into the UK. The ""harmonised"" voltage standard between the EU and UK is just a paper work of fiction and tolerance fudging, nothing really changed, and on average EU voltages will be about 10 volts lower so extremely unlikely to trigger this issue.

Most 230 volt appliances will work with a higher than normal voltage - just with a higher risk of blowing up or wearing out faster (especially bulbs) however an EV is one of the few things that will do critical checks on the voltage and refuse to operate if the voltage is outside its ""acceptable"" bounds. 

Now I think back I remember someone who was reporting their Ion/C-Zero kept stopping charging randomly or rarely managed to charge all the way to 100% without stopping prematurely - in hindsight I'd say there is a good chance their mains voltage was too high! (Potentially too low could cause the same issue, although unlikely to happen with our higher than EU average voltages)

It could also explain some charge failures at public charging points. If only there was an easy way to measure the voltage at public Type 2 charge points... Hmmm....",1,1881673

Is any testing of the ability of an EV to charge reliably across the full range of mains voltages provided in the UK made at the time an EV is submitted for type approval for sale in the UK ?

For the Ion I'll give it the benefit of the doubt - it would have originally been submitted for approval in 2009 which is a while ago now and around the time the voltage harmonisation work was in progress.

However are all new EV's sold today tested to ensure that they can charge reliably on any UK socket/charge point that is within the current prescribed voltage limits ? I'd place a wager that this testing has in fact not been done, or is not part of the type approval process in practice.

If so this is something that needs addressing because the last thing we need with mass deployment of EV's is ""random"" charging failures either at home or on the public charging network that are due to voltages near the UK's maximum tolerance limit which the car cannot handle.

That actually depends entirely on the nature of the load. For large passive loads this is not the case. Incandescent light bulbs, electric showers, electric heaters and heating elements of all kinds, oven etc, will all use less instantaneous power if you drop the supply voltage.

Anything with a thermostat will however stay on longer on average to compensate - if an oven is trying to stay at 200C and the heat output of the element is reduced by the lower voltage the element will need to have a greater on-time duty cycle to maintain the same temperature - so average power consumption will be the same.

Likewise a fridge compressor would draw less power while running but would have to run with a greater duty cycle to keep your food cold - so no gain there either.

A kettle would draw less power but would take correspondingly longer to boil the water so use about the same kWh.

Even a toaster would have the same issue - the elements would draw less power and wouldn't get as hot, but the toasting time would have to be increased to get the same degree of crispiness of your bread! 

Anything using a switch mode power supply will as you suggest automatically draw more current to compensate for the lower voltage as the electronics it is running will still see a regulated voltage from the output of the power supply and draw the exact same amount of current/power, which will have to be provided by increased duty cycle of the switcher and thus increased current draw at the mains.

So among household devices the only things I can think of which would have a genuine reduction in the kWh that they use are incandescent bulbs and electric showers. So all in all not worth it, unless your mains voltage was abnormally high and devices were being damaged because of it.

I am not convinced by that as a one-off statement.

For sure it would be a scam to declare that they can help any piece of electronics, it would be very device-specific.

However, there are old switch mode supplies that do just generate a lot of heat when they run on higher voltage.

I would tend to agree that it is less common to see 'wasteful' switch mode supplies these days, because operating power is something measured and reported, and consumers do look at those numbers.

I recall putting a simple dimmer switch on my monitors and measured through a power-factor tolerant power meter it recorded good energy gains after a period of operation. Of course the power factor was affected, but it is not going to cause the mains any sort of disturbance at those low power ratings.",0,None

I would say/speculate that is often merely because the minimum voltage to power the logic devices on board is 10~11V. When the solenoids and such try to activate, they will pull the battery voltage down and the logic de-powers causing them to open again.

On-board devices should all be tested for voltage drop, but it is up to the manufacturer what the lowest operating voltage is that they are prepared to accept from the suppliers. It might add a euro to make an existing system tolerant to a lower supply voltage, or conversely they might save a euro by setting the minimum operating voltage to very close to normal operation. 

In a way it's a shame that, as consumers, we can't simply offer to pay a teeny bit extra to get better quality parts into the cars we buy, these cost/benefit balances are all done by the manufacturers. But the problems of creating 'A-class', 'B-class', etc, variants with higher quality parts just isn't going to happen.",0,1882113

The law in the UK currently states that the mains supply voltage must be 230 V +10% / -6%, thereby allowing the European 220 V system to stay at 220 V and the UK to stay at 240 V, yet both appear to be harmonised! 

In 2010, the voltage tolerance band may be increased to +10% but again, in reality, nothing will really change!

Dear, @Johnny Read,

I am keeping the car without registering it (considering that I am going to sell or part it out any way), so it is not actually possible for me to test the real life usable range.
Anyhow, I believe as a donor it could be a perfect one.
Is there a chance that you know somebody who owns that kind of property?

Most of the codes you've listed are communications errors between ECU's:

This car was eventually fixed.

You say the 12v battery has been ""checked"" - checked how ? Unless it has been capacity tested (discharge test) then it's likely to appear OK on a voltage test but fail under load.

Can you put a volt meter across the battery after the car has been turned off for an hour, then put it across the battery with the car turned on in READY mode (assuming it will still go into ready) and report both voltages ? One reason for this test is to ensure that the DC-DC converter is still able to charge the 12v battery. If not, that's a whole other can of worms...

If the 12V battery is the original I would still be inclined to replace it. I had to replace the 12v battery in my 2011 Ion more than a year ago and it was totally stuffed. It was a miracle the car was still working. 6-8 years seems to be the maximum the 12v battery will last before it is severely degraded in capacity. This can go un-noticed as there is no heavy drain load like a starter motor that the battery has to supply before the car turns on.

Most of those fault codes reporting comms errors could have been set when the 12v battery was very low and would still be memorised until cleared even if the original fault has since been fixed.

P1A02 is an error code for the gear position switch, so I'd strongly recommend you lubricate all the joints for the gear lever cable with spray grease, (with a directional nozzle) see the following thread:









C-Zero/Ion charging failure due to stiff gear lever...


There's a number of threads here and in the Mitsubishi section of the forum about the gear lever getting stiff on these and being reluctant to stay in drive or park due to the mechanism under the car. I'd like to add to this that it can also cause a failure to charge even on Level 2, as I...




www.speakev.com





Later cars like yours have a slightly simpler linkage mechanism with less joints but still seize up.

If the ECU can't figure out with confidence what position the gear lever is in, it won't let you charge or drive the car, depending on which position is faulty, and a flashing gear indication almost certainly means the switch isn't reading correctly. So far everyone with this problem has cured it by lubricating the pivots shown in the thread above.

You'll probably find the gear lever feels a bring springy at the moment when going into park or drive - after lubricating it should move positively into these positions without any springiness. If not try a bit more lubrication.

I'm located in Motherwell not too far from you and have a Diagbox diagnostic tool for the Ion/C-Zero. In normal conditions I would probably be willing to pay a quick visit to put the diagnostic tool on and see the problems first hand, however unfortunately in the current coronavirus conditions I'm not really able to do that, (extended family member still shielding) but I and others on here can hopefully talk you through diagnosing the problem remotely.

Edit: Re-reading your post and saw mention of the tortise icon when you try to go above 10mph. At the time this happens what charge percentage is indicated ?

This has been incredibly helpful. Thank you. I need to run through a number of the points you and the others have suggested and will report back once I have done so. I think it will be a wise investment to change the 12v battery and grease the cables as suggested. I'll then see whether that makes a difference.
I'm not at all DIY Savvy but the McConachies here in Haddington are very supportive in trying to help - I've been up to them about three times and they ran a diagnostic (twice) and tested the Battery - Just the amp test though - and even though I've offered to pay for their time they just said no worries.

I have a quick other question - Before I got the battery replaced I checked to see that I had the Radio code and looking at the back of the owners manual found what I thought was what I needed. It says radio code and then has a long sequence ending with 4 numbers in bold. I took it to mean that the 4 numbers in bold where the input codes. However they did not work. Was I correct in thinking this should have been the code? Or should I be contacting Peugeot with this code to get the actual radio code? Or is it somewhere else?

My radio was also locked out when I got the car due to a previous flat 12v battery and the seller (an indy garage) wasn't able to fix it for me in time before I bought the car so they knocked a little bit off the price for the non working radio...

As soon as I got it home I used my Diagbox/Lexia 3 diagnostic tool to reset the lockout and retrieve the code for the radio.  So anyone who has a recent PSA (Citroen/Peugeot) Diagbox diagnostic tool can unlock the radio and retrieve the radio code for future use.

Peugeot of course can do this too as Diagbox is their official dealer diagnostic tool. How much they might charge you to do this I have no idea.",0,None

Thread necromancy, but this is an important lesson that everyone needs to bear in mind when dealing with faults before tunning the parts cannons loose

""Lots of errors"" almost always has a common cause - whether that's a bad battery or a bad connector or a wiring fault or a bad earth - these ARE the most common causes, not electronics faults.

Dealers are particularly bad news for this kind of behaviour because they fail to fix things but still charge top dollar. It can be amusing to demand they remove parts from a repair job and see them squirm",0,2844405

Hmm... I was afraid of that. The curious things though, it was the amber not red light, and no tortoise. And why no fault codes logged? I'll ask our indi if he checked the cell balance, and if he can do so. They are a great bunch, not EV specialists, but willing to give it a go. I've also emailed an EV specialist, but no reply yet, so they may currently be closed. 
Technically it should have warranty, but I've no service record.

I just got a Peugeot iOn and I can't get the charging to work from the 7 kW wall box, but it does charge with the granny charger. I had a Renault Zoe a year ago which charged from the box with no issues, and there are no signs of damage (the app says everything is fine and can detect the car, but the car doesn't seem to allow charging to happen).

I believe the iOn is limited to 16 A, but my charger can modulate so I don't think this would be an issue. In the manual, it only mentions the granny charger and there is no mention of mode 3 charging, but surely this is possible? When I stick the cable in, the red charger light on the dash flashes 2 or 3 times so it does detect it, but for some reason it doesn't allow charging to happen.

Any ideas?

Click to expand...

Few ways to test.
Try public charge post.
If this does not work change the cable 
If this does not work it's the car.

From my understanding the ion does not have a type two and various cables can be used including some form of adaptor which can be used with a type 2 cable.

Hi Glenn,

The iOn is the same as the i-Miev and c-Zero. We drive to Poole and back regularly on a single charge so you'd have no problem getting the car back to Bournemouth on a single charge.

Hopefully the title is self explanatory, but we have a new (to us) 2012 Peugeot ion which refuses to work with the EO chargers at my office. Supposedly these are 22KW and they are non-tethered Type 2 connectors which I am using with a Type 2 to Type 1 lead.

I appreciate the car only has a 3KW charger, but I have used the same lead on other public charging points (e.g. Pod Point) which are 7KW and it charges fine, but obviously only at the 3KW rate. It also charges fine from the Granny Lead at home.

With the EO charger it seems to connect ok (lights flash, the car shows up in the app as connected) but the light on the charging station never changes from flashing green to solid green and the car doesn't charge.

I have tried with another brand new Type 1 - Type 2 lead so it's not a fault with the lead itself so far as I can see (although I guess it may possibly still be the wrong type).

I just wondered if anyone had come across this and whether it's a known issue (for example 22KW charger is too much for the car to handle etc.)?

22 kW charge points are three phase, 7 kW ones are single phase. Shouldn't be a problem, but it's possible that there may be an issue with the way your Type 2 to Type 1 adapter is handling the CP, or possibly may be related to the way the car is reading the PP resistance. In theory, a Type 2 to Type 1 adapter should present a switched resistance value between PP and PE, so the charger (in the car) can measure the PP resistance to get the adapter cable current rating. However, Type 2 to Type 1 adapters aren't part of the standard, so there may well be inconsistencies as to how they handle this.

Only way to narrow down the cause would be to do some measurements at the Type 1 connector end when connected to the Type 2 cable from the charge point. The microswitch operated by the Type 1 lever switches the PP resistance to PE, and if there is some sort of feedthrough connection down the charge point adapter cable this may be creating an issue. In theory the PP shouldn't have a cable conductor, but some charge points do seem to have an extra PP wire. Not sure why this is, as the standard is pretty clear that the PP should not be connected via a cable conductor.

OK, so the EO is a type 2 socket. That means there is no ""adaptor"" from type 2 to type 1 involved, scrub those theories.

Best bet is to read the fault code, HOBDrive (paid for version) is cheap and seems to pick up most fault codes.

Report back with the fault code.

You could also ask the sparky at work to put a recording scope on the phase to neutral voltage in the supply to the EO. (measuring the same phase as your cable connects to).

Thanks - I will try and get the fault code. The warning lamp is just a generic one for faults with the traction electrical system so could be pretty much anything. 

You are right I'm not using an adaptor it's just a charging lead with Type 2 at the charging point end and Type 1 at the car end.

Ignore this reply, the fact that very first iMievs were direct charging is completely irrelevant to the discussion in hand.

It will be the charger input voltage (from the charge point) that has that voltage limit, as the output voltage from the charger will be around 400 VDC, or whetver the battery voltage happens to be (varies a bit from one EV to another).

246 VAC is really low as an over voltage trigger for the UK, as the allowable maximum supply voltage here is 253 VAC. The UK LV grid voltage is often around 240 to 245 VAC, even though it's supposed to be 230 VAC, +10%, -6%.

Click to expand...

That was me that reported this issue with high voltage preventing charging.

My Peugeot Ion (now sold) would not charge if the mains voltage was over 246 volts. There is a thread about it on here somewhere where I went into the details but I'm too lazy to search for it just now. 

This was discovered during the beast from the east when our mains voltage which is usually 230-240v went up to 248 volts for a couple of days and the car refused to charge. The charge light on the dashboard normally flashes red for a couple of seconds while checks are being performed then goes solid red when charging starts. When the voltage was 247v or above it would do the initial flashing then after a few seconds abort with an error. I don't recall if the yellow warning light came on but it may well have, and it does set a fault code in the OBC which can be read with a diagnostic tool as well.

My workaround for those two days of high voltage was to start charging with a heavy load turned on in the house - something like an electric heater/shower etc. This would allow the charge to start and because it was very close to the threshold voltage the load from the car itself charging was just enough to keep the voltage below the threshold without leaving the other device on the whole time. (However if it had been significantly higher voltage this probably wouldn't have worked)

Yes, failing to charge above 246 volts is non-compliant with UK mains voltages unfortunately that's the way the i-Miev triplets seem to be, or at least the earlier ones with the original OBC charger design. (The charger was revised around 2015)

Interestingly I think the root cause of the issue may be a measurement error inside the OBC - if you read the incomming AC voltage reported by the OBC via a diagnostic tool and software like Canion the reported voltage is considerably higher than the true voltage, by some 5-10 volts or so. (Can't remember the exact figure)

This over estimation of the actual mains voltage by the OBC is likely why it stops charging at too low a voltage, although how that slippped through QA I don't know.

As industrial estates can often be near the high end of the allowed voltage range, especially after hours, this is a genuine problem for these cars.",0,3121606

Name: Unnamed: 0, dtype: int64",92944,"Mar 18, 2021","Just a thought:
Have you guys with proximity key issues checked the 12v battery state ?

From what you are describing it sounds like maybe the 12v battery voltage gets low when not using the car, and then it might shut off some accessories (like the proximity sensor) to minimize battery drain, but still leave the RF receiver on (so you can unlock with the keyfob button).

Then, after driving a bit, the 12v gets charged again and you can use the proximity during the day.

In my Corsa-e (which shares the keyfob, and also other PSA hardware with the e208/e2008) I haven't had any issues with the proximity key.
Sometimes it's even a bit too sensitive in my opinion: When walking by the car, about 1.5 meters from it, if I forgot the key in my pocket, it will open/lock...

For example, when I need to charge my car, I leave a door open, so that it won't lock/unlock many times until I connect the cable (I think it's safer to have the key on me, than leave it in the car).

Anyways, I suggest you monitor the 12v battery (there are various 12v battery monitors out there, some have Bluetooth, so you can monitor it without opening the car).
Check to see if the voltage of the 12v is low (should be a bit above 12v, like 12.5v...) when proximity doesn't work.
If that's the case, I would suppose either the 12v battery they put in the Peugeot are rubbish, or maybe something else is draining the battery.

I noticed that when sitting in the car, while it's still off, if you use the myOpel app (same as myPeugeot app, just different branding), and try to see the HV battery status (like how many % you got left), it ""wakes up"" the infotainment system, and ambient lighting too.
So that may also drain the 12v if you use it alot while the car is off.

I haven't checked what kind of 12v battery they put in the Corsa-e, but I know that sometimes they put standard ICE 12v batteries in EVs too, which don't like deeper discharging. A deep discharge can actually ruin the 12v battery, and therefore lower its performance and reliability.

Good luck, and keep us posted!",0,None

AFAIK, most anti scanning solutions rely on the key: If the key is not moved for a few minutes, it stops responding. Then when the key is moved, it ""wakes up"" and returns to respond.

But I suppose that is not the issue, because you are probably moving the key while approaching the car.

I'm not even sure PSA has implemented this anti scanning feature in its keyfobs.",0,2982483

For example, when I need to charge my car, I leave a door open, so that it won't lock/unlock many times until I connect the cable (I think it's safer to have the key on me, than leave it in the car).

Anyways, I suggest you monitor the 12v battery (there are various 12v battery monitors out there, some have Bluetooth, so you can monitor it without opening the car).
Check to see if the voltage of the 12v is low (should be a bit above 12v, like 12.5v...) when proximity doesn't work.
If that's the case, I would suppose either the 12v battery they put in the Peugeot are rubbish, or maybe something else is draining the battery.

I noticed that when sitting in the car, while it's still off, if you use the myOpel app (same as myPeugeot app, just different branding), and try to see the HV battery status (like how many % you got left), it ""wakes up"" the infotainment system, and ambient lighting too.
So that may also drain the 12v if you use it alot while the car is off.

I haven't checked what kind of 12v battery they put in the Corsa-e, but I know that sometimes they put standard ICE 12v batteries in EVs too, which don't like deeper discharging. A deep discharge can actually ruin the 12v battery, and therefore lower its performance and reliability.

Good luck, and keep us posted!

Thanks for the suggestion - the 12v battery is an interesting idea. Given Peugeot have also told me my phone (Pixel 5) is not compatible with the vehicle, I wonder whether the app behaves in an odd way - although that might be a bit of a stretch. I'll ask the dealer to have a look at it when it's in on the 23rd. 

One other possiblity that Google threw up yesterday was that there was an issue with the lock / sensor in the boot (I think someone with a different PSA vehicle). Since then the proximity key has failed 2-3 times, and on each occasion I've found that instead of taking the key apart and opening the driver's door, it was enough for me to leave the key in my pocket and open the boot. This appeared to trigger the central locaking, the lights flash and the car opens. 

This does imply that the proximity senor is still powered and functional, so maybe an issue with the boot mechanism. It's odd how just pressing the boot release button above the number plate wakes up the whole car and remembers that it's supposed to be unlocking itself. 

One thing I had noticed is that the body coloured module that houses the number plate lights and boot mechanism feels a little 'loose'. It's definitely one I'll be asked Peugeot to look at when it goes in, irrepective of whether they are able to recreate the fault - maybe third time's the charm....",0,2982571

Have just got the car back from the dealership, who miraculously were able to recreate the fault overnight. Transpires that the manufacturer are aware of and looking into a known issue with EVs that share this platform, where the keyless/central locking fails but the car can be unlocked by opening the boot.

Now waiting on a fix to be identified, however long that might take. They did say that it helps if anyone else experiencing the same can get their dealer to raise a fault ticket, then it will become more of a priority to get a technical directive sorted to address it.",0,2982773

Does this sound like the classic ""bad capacitor causes fuse to blow"" problem?

Click to expand...

It does.

One way to check would be to put a volt meter across the 12v battery when the car is turned off, take note of the voltage (which should be around 12 - 13 volts) and then turn the car on to ready to drive mode, ensuring that the green READY does in fact appear.

Normally this should instantly raise the voltage to 14.2 - 14.6 volts, if the voltage does not rise or drops then the DC/DC converter is not working which very likely means the 20 amp fuse in the MCU is blown and the disc capacitors in the OBC have blown. This is what happened to mine. I was able to repair mine for the cost of a new fuse, (which I had to order from Japan) some capacitors and some black silicon sealant to re-pot the capacitor area, (since you have to dig it all out to get at them) however I have a fair bit of electronics repair experience - it's not a job for an electronics newbie, but any competent electronics repairer should be able to do it if they are given the right information on the fault and how to repair it.

Madrid Ion said:



Hello everyone.

Some advice, please!

I have a (much loved) 2011 Peugeot Ion.

Recently the car stopped mid-drive, and the yellow ""!"" car warning light appeared on the dashboard. The car restarted and we were able to drive home. But now the car won't charge, the warning light stays on, sometimes the car will drive for a few meters but then stop, sometimes it won't drive at all.

The local Peugeot garage took the car. They replaced the 12V starter battery. This did not fix the problem.

They say they have run some diagnostics and are convinced that the ""electrical convertor"" has failed and needs to be replaced at a cost of ‚Ç¨6894.

I am not 100% convinced that their mechanics know anything about the Ion, or indeed any electric cars. I worry there may be a much simpler, cheaper solution that they are missing. Before I consider paying this much money, does anyone have any alternative solutions?

Thank you.

Neil, Madrid

Certainly all the announcements around the electric seem to focus on the fact the price is higher (without giving the actual price away yet) but that you would gain that back in the lifetime of the vehicle.

Yes its hard to know exactly what the new proposed business spec is like with the refreshed update to the trims - all of the 360 views etc seem to point to the business trim, but this is a new EV only ""business edition"" which is different - the addition of two captains seats up front and the rear seats being removable suggest it may be a little more upmarket than the vivaro, but its not clear

This may well be the problem as this is the DVLA and how car licences work and nothing to do with Europe where the licences are different.
The relevant type of license causing the problem is this I think.

Category B - if you passed your test on or after 1 January 1997

You can drive vehicles up to 3,500kg MAM with up to 8 passenger seats (with a trailer up to 750kg).

Maximum authorised mass (MAM) means the weight of a vehicle or trailer including the maximum load that can be carried safely when it‚Äôs being used on the road.

Those who passed before then could drive the larger battery version fully laden  You would need a C1 license now I guess for the larger battery version.

Yup, normally people who past post 97 can only drive up to 3.5tonnes but a hybrid or electric van you can go up to 4.5 tonnes. Its a good law with respect to making sure electric vans aren't too crippled by having a big battery, but it does seem an odd rule - if you can drive an EV fine up to 4.5 tonnes why can you suddently not because it has an ICE?

Simon abbo said:



Hello all, 

I purchased a 2014 Peugeot Ion the other week with only 4,000kms on the clock, it is in pristine condition. I dearly love it and it is perfect for our needs.

the problem we found on day one (after an overnight charge on the house socket charging at 8amps) is it will not charge fully (I only get an 80% reading) and the yellow car with exclamation mark warning light lights up intermittently on the dash, sometimes while charging, sometimes while driving. Because we had only just bought it, the person we bought it from (trader) paid Peugeot to run a diagnostics test and the resulting problem and cure for them seems to be a complete battery pack replacement at a cost of 16,000 Euros. 

I am returning to the seller next week and he has the codes from the diagnostics. (seeing he paid the bill)

So, I am here to pick your brains if I may. 

I'm not going to even enter into a discussion on the battery replacement with the seller as it is way way way more than the cost of the car, so that is out, but, when charged, the car still allows 81kms of range which we can at a stretch work for us but the top 3 bars if they illuminated then those extra kms would have been such a cherry on the cake. 

I know this may all be a moot point as I am yet to find out the fault codes but I wanted to ask here if I should re consider walking back and handing the keys back to the seller and walking away from the deal which is right now my only sensible option right? right?

I'm not sure if anyone has had the fault of not having the battery indicate anymore charge than 80%, I haven't as yet been able to find anything in this realm online. 

I have seen people online suggesting all sorts from the ability to replace individual cells within the battery pack once the failed ones have been discovered (if that indeed is the problem in my case) 

I'm sorry if this all seems like a random waffle but I'm just wanting to see if there are any opinions out there giving me another angle to think about. for example.. if the batteries are just deteriorated but not in the area of just giving up completely while driving but will continue to charge to 80% for many years to come (of course i understand this can only be an assumption as with any vehicle) then I would consider going back to the seller and asking for some price reduction or such like. 

I don't know batteries but if this helps, this ION i bought was part of a fleet which had the lowest mileage, (the highest was over 130,000 kms) my simple assumption was this must have been kept near the head office and only used rarely but was it left on charge all the time and was it left on charge on a fast charger and is that why the battery won't now charge past 80%

If you got here on this, my first foray into forums then thank you for reading this. I'm happy to answer any questions but as you can see from above I have not fully elaborated on everything, If I did this would probably have a hardback cover and need to be in print. hahaha. 

Thank you all for your time and I hope someone can help.

Much love all, Simon

Thank you kindly for your thoughts. Yes I'm leaning that way but also doing as much research as possible before I hand the keys back. The Garage that carried out the fault test was a large Peugeot garage but seemed to know little of the ION and sent away the info to get thoughts from another garage so while I'm waiting to see the seller again I'm seeing if there is any info I can take along to help with my situation. I know i may be stretching for hopes but I have worked in garages and engineering and have often seen conclusions come to ""ahh just change it"" rather than dig for the true issue which could be something simpler than a complete change of battery pack. I will have maybe a better idea once i get the fault codes too. 

Thanks again for your time, much appreciated.",0,3272842

Hello all,

I purchased a 2014 Peugeot Ion the other week with only 4,000kms on the clock, it is in pristine condition. I dearly love it and it is perfect for our needs.

the problem we found on day one (after an overnight charge on the house socket charging at 8amps) is it will not charge fully (I only get an 80% reading) and the yellow car with exclamation mark warning light lights up intermittently on the dash, sometimes while charging, sometimes while driving. Because we had only just bought it, the person we bought it from (trader) paid Peugeot to run a diagnostics test and the resulting problem and cure for them seems to be a complete battery pack replacement at a cost of 16,000 Euros.

I am returning to the seller next week and he has the codes from the diagnostics. (seeing he paid the bill)

So, I am here to pick your brains if I may.

I'm not going to even enter into a discussion on the battery replacement with the seller as it is way way way more than the cost of the car, so that is out, but, when charged, the car still allows 81kms of range which we can at a stretch work for us but the top 3 bars if they illuminated then those extra kms would have been such a cherry on the cake.

I know this may all be a moot point as I am yet to find out the fault codes but I wanted to ask here if I should re consider walking back and handing the keys back to the seller and walking away from the deal which is right now my only sensible option right? right?

I'm not sure if anyone has had the fault of not having the battery indicate anymore charge than 80%, I haven't as yet been able to find anything in this realm online.

I have seen people online suggesting all sorts from the ability to replace individual cells within the battery pack once the failed ones have been discovered (if that indeed is the problem in my case)

I'm sorry if this all seems like a random waffle but I'm just wanting to see if there are any opinions out there giving me another angle to think about. for example.. if the batteries are just deteriorated but not in the area of just giving up completely while driving but will continue to charge to 80% for many years to come (of course i understand this can only be an assumption as with any vehicle) then I would consider going back to the seller and asking for some price reduction or such like.

I don't know batteries but if this helps, this ION i bought was part of a fleet which had the lowest mileage, (the highest was over 130,000 kms) my simple assumption was this must have been kept near the head office and only used rarely but was it left on charge all the time and was it left on charge on a fast charger and is that why the battery won't now charge past 80%

If you got here on this, my first foray into forums then thank you for reading this. I'm happy to answer any questions but as you can see from above I have not fully elaborated on everything, If I did this would probably have a hardback cover and need to be in print. hahaha.

Thank you all for your time and I hope someone can help.

Much love all, Simon

Extremely low miles is not good for a EV and if it left plugged into a charger or more frequently near discharged then the batt will have been wrecked. Sorry not a good choice but if you find out more information you can at least make informed decision. I would return for the reason Donald gives.

Can't disagree with you at all and appreciate your point. it's a difficult decision really because the car looks like it just drove out of the showroom and we all love it as a family but definitely not going to keep hold of it if the batteries are messed up.

Yes and no. Yes totally from the heart because we all love this car and it has cost relatively little but also no because over some decades of working as an aircraft engineer in the past I have seen a component costing a few dollars grounding multi million dollar aircraft for weeks at a time. Not knowing how this car works or what the codes are yet my heart is hoping the knowledge from my past has some credence and would have been great if someone on here had experienced the same issue with very little expense to put right.

Saying all that though, totally see your point and am totally prepared to hand the keys back if I get no joy with info.",0,3273472

Thanks for the detailed response, Much appreciated. I am still looking for answers before I think about finally returning the car and walking away from the deal and as you say about the other things to consider outside the low mileage, everything shows how well this car was looked after. I said ""Pristine"" in my original post which maybe over simplified the rest of the condition of the car. it is in show room condition but, has this charge issue i found. from my research it seems the average (realistic) range for a car my age is around 80kms per charge. my range states 84kms but cuts out charging at 80% charge on the dash. Outside of the charge issue the car looks like It came out the factory only weeks ago. So was at the time the correct purchase, but saying all that, I'm quite happy to return the keys if I can (or can't) find the answers I need. 

Thanks again for your time and response.

Yes you are right on all counts, But I also consider the fact all the mileage is pretty local, so if an issue happens then as long as I am not blocking the road and being unsafe then the expense of the breakdown is the only real worry and if the inevitable happened then it would pretty much be game over for the car, so yes that cost would be pretty brutal and something which I can ill afford (hence the purchase in the first place, only recently my previous car cost nearly 200Euros to fill up with fuel). Considering the price I paid for the car though, and after seeing one of the same cars in the lot with over 130,000kms on it I could also have the good fortune to have the car run and run and run and by the time the batteries give up, the cost of a replacement battery pack could have reduced enough to make the gamble of keeping the car pay off.",0,3273921

This is by no way what I am doing even though maybe I am forever the optimist or just (as mentioned above) letting my heart rule my head.

I don't understand electrics or electric vehicles but have had experience with cars from a very early age so I'm doing my due diligence before even considering handing the car back and walking away from what could be exactly what we need for us as a family without breaking the bank.

Help!

My 2011 Peugeot Ion has been getting really difficult/stiff to change gear, particularly when changing into Park after I've been driving. When it does this, I have to reepeatedly shift down to B or C and back to Park and it usually goes in the 4th or 5th time. When it's working, it seems just fine and then I parkit and it goes again.

Up until now it was just intermittent, maybe 5% of the time or less, then it would go back to normal, but now it won't go back into Park at all. It's currently stuck by the side of the road a few miles from home.

Transmission fluid? If so, anyone have a guide on how to change it?

They seem to have introduced it in a bit of a hurry, removing everything and creating a new account and then setting it up from scratch did offer face recognition but no fingerprint authentication but it used a phrase that suggested it would do away with the pin. I left it at that.
The point is that it's supposedly an easy to use app that helps you not something you have to battle with and use passwords and pins left, right and centre just to warm the car up or see where you might have been if you've woken up in a skip and have no recollection, so I feel they should give you a choice on the level of security from none required to 2LA.
Most oeoples phones will track everywhere they have been right down to a couple of metres which is usually much closer than their car might be.

Lets hope future versions are a little more flexible.

If they could give a fingerprint option instead of logging in or Pin then it would be less intrusive but still a level of security to please whoever insists on it.

What the spec actually says is ""80% charged in 30 minutes from a 100kWh terminal"". Battery capacity is quoted as 56kWh. That means they are planning an average charge rate of 56x0.8x2=89.6kW from (let's say) 10-90% SoC...and that's ignoring charging losses.

I had a test drive yesterday. I drove the e-208 a few weeks ago and found it to be a bit too small for my needs. I thought that the e-2008 would be bigger but it wasn't in reality. Sure the tin bits were bigger but the interior wasn't noticeably larger and the boot still quite small. Almost like a reverse tardis. As the running gear is the same then it is also a bit less efficient and a bit lower range. A nice drive and a competent car overall. That annoying feature where the steering wheel can obscure the view to the dashboard is still there. I had to position the wheel much lower than I would want it so that the dash could be seen - as I did in the 208. Not a deal-breaker, but added to the other negatives enough to cause me to strike it off the list.",0,2869695

It's a special edition, only 1000 like this. Though since I've had it, I've seen quite a few other cars from the same and different brands with similar colour schemes. There are a number of Fiestas, Polos, A1s, and older Corsas, all with red paint and black wheels and roof. Not many take it all the way with black badges, but a few do.









It goes in cycles. Growing up in the 80s, chrome looked expensive and was only on posh cars, then it moved to cheap cars, and then posh cars were blacked out and chrome looked cheap. The same in the 90s and naughties, and I'm sure it will go round and round again.",1,3424011

As I suggested in my response to your email yesterday, its likely to be a duff cell (s). This isnt an on site job. To get to the cells you have to lift the vehicle off the battery pack. (Even though it is split in two parts its heavy) The large section weighs a bit over 1/2 a tonne, not an option on a couple of trolley jacks.
Once the pack is out and the duff / depleted cells found, you then have to charge the cells separately to get them back to match the rest, or charge/ discharge a new cell to match the rest. This can take days.
I do rent a netbook to enable onsite diagnosis of the problem, if you dont have access to a terminal style program, like hyperterminal. At least then you would have an understanding of the degree of problem and then an understaning of the way forward with some idea of costs.
I have stocks of matching new 160ah cells, initialised, tested and ready to be installed. I can supply these discharged to a voltage to match the rest of the pack at an extra cost, but it does take couple of days to get this anywhere near the static voltage of the other cells.

On the expert front, I have just finished retrofitting the three phase and single phase charger from a Boxer into an expert. One issue is cooling the charger which relies on a heat sink on one side. As its about 50mmbehind the main radiator, there isnt much space, so I have a new main fan control that kicks the fan over to a separate power supply when the charger is on line, and then uses a thermo sensor, to bring the fan on. Since the fan consumes a lot of power and isnt needed to be so powerful, it now has a PWM motor controller cutting the fan power down to a gentle whirr and easily drops the temp pf the charger. 
I have also now installed a 12v battery monotor system, that brings the pack online and the DC to DC for two hours when the 12v battery reaches 12.2v for 20 seconds (allows a short blip for central locking) Its disabled (if still within the two hours)and resets when you start the vehicle. Works a treat and should stop the 12v going flat which is a real issue with these vehicles if left for a few days.
This expert is also gettng a Type two inlet at the front where the Peugeot badge was, ala Leaf. Just got to find a local company who can vinyl print an image of the original Peugeot badge to cover the new flat hatch.",0,None

I have the same issue. but only when I try to rapid charge with DC. The charge point scotland call handler said that it was a software issue and that charge point scotland points i was using were older style so not compatible? I can charge on type 2. I don't know if this is fact as I've seen other new vehicles charge on rapid so may its just my car brand that has different software? anyone able to use rapid charge on charge point with my model of car?",0,None

If you're looking for bigger then this is definitrly the right choice since the Kona is actually smaller than the Ioniq in may ways. It looks way bigger than it really is!

I've ended up ordering the DS3 Crossback because it was available a month sooner than the 2008. I am a bit concerned about the range so will see how it goes.

Yeah it's looking that way. Will give it a go in Aug/Sep and see how close it gets. Will swap it for something else if it's too tight or go back to the Ioniq. 

It's one third A+B roads, 50 mph limit. Then two thirds motorway although the last 5-10 miles is slow and start-stop traffic. All fairly flat. I'll make sure I start with 100% charge. The Ioniq did the same journey in July using just 55% of the battery.",1,3062073

Whilst slightly disadvantaged when compared to the e-208 and the Corsa-e because of the increased weight, you‚Äôll still be able to achieve ~130 miles range in the depth of winter.

Using the range calculator on their website which is quite accurate, even slightly pessimistic, you‚Äôd get a range of 140 miles on a 0 deg day in Normal mode with the A/C heating on with an average speed of 60mph which, based on your route details is very optimistic. If your average speed drops to a more realistic 50mph, that range will increase to ~166 miles.

Obviously, headwinds and wet (not damp) roads will have an adverse effect on those figures. However, using the similar calculator for the Corsa-e which has the same battery and motor, when compared to my own experience over more than a year with the car is that you will do better than the calculated figures as long as you are not heavy footed.

During the depth of winter last year, on a dry but cold day (~5 deg C) with little wind, I could easily achieve 3.4 miles/kWh driving at 65mph on the motorway in Normal mode with a/c heating on. That translates to 153 miles range. So, your 106 mile round trip commute will not be a worry. Ignore the naysayers who have no experience with the actual car or it‚Äôs siblings.

Have a look at the range calculator here: DS 3 Crossback E-Tense | 100% Electric SUV | DS Automobiles

Thanks, that is reassuring. The benefit of getting through Onto is if it doesn't work out I will swap it for something else. By mid-winter I expect I will either have got something on a longer term lease or bought (looking at the Skoda Enyaq) or the traffic will be so bad again that I will go back to commuting by train!

Excellent choice of cheap EV motoring I also got myself a low mileage Ion and have found it an excellent car to run around in for 95% of my travels I only use an ICE now when I have to tow something or do a long distance journey.

What you have found is perfectly normal for the Ion but having just had a puncture in one of the rear tyres on my Ion I'd make a worthwhile suggestion to you. Get yourself a jack and a wheel brace. This is what is missing from the 'tool kit' under your rear seat. The aerosol repair kit is a waste of space and ought to be made illegal.

I had a piece of crockery punch through my tyre (no idea how it got there must have been in a pothole some place) and had I had a spare tyre and a jack and wheel-brace I could have been off and on my way in all of 3 minutes. With no jack and no brace to remove the tyre ..... Well how do you move a car and get a repair? This is not just a MiEV feature it's found in many modern cars nowadays. Unfortunately the Ion has different front and rear tyre sizes so a spare is always going to be a problem but it's a real simple thing to get a wheel-brace and a jack and carry it with you in the car so you can get the tyre fixed when you need it done.

Another irritating 'feature' / lack of feature, is that there's no clock. Simple solution here for that also is to get a cheap LCD clock from Maplin or other electrical retailer and get yourself some magnetic adhesive tape to pop on top of the dashboard and hey presto you now have a clock on the dash that you will look at several times on every journey. It's surprising how many times you do it but you don't notice until the clock is missing.

Oh also on the seatbelt warning lights.... If you happen to pop something such as a packed lunch or torch onto the passenger seat when you quickly nip up the road to fetch something. you may find the seatbelt warning light comes on occasionally on the dash. The weight sensor in the front seats are a bit overly sensitive.

Another thing to be aware of is that there have recently been a couple of compulsory recalls on the Ion one for the brakes and one for the main traction battery. Contact your Peugeot dealer and get them seen to it is a free safety recall and there is no charge.",1,None

Yes, I have the follwoing rule set for outgoing traffic on my Pfsense firewall. If you have a standard home router, it likely is only filtering incoming traffic so should be a non-issue. They are usually basic stateless firewalls.

Not me you quoted, but no one is safe really. Any organisation that allows even the the most restricted forms of access to the Internet can be hit. Unless every worker is an IT-expert and has no access to email, cannot click any links and cannot run any applications that is not controlled and made by the company, it can happen.

Some part of my organisation has a whitelist for sites that can be visited. That is because they are handling bank-related stuff.
They cannot go and visit just any site, we have restricted their access to just the sites they need in their work. Even though that minimizes the threat alot, it does not remove it and it is not fun for the employees that cannot visit forums,cannot watch videos, cannot read news sites, just visit the sites they work with.They cannot even Google. Imagine that!
But that is more or less what is needed to be safe in combination of course with that they cannot install anything, computer based or user based.

Even so, it's not impossible that even those users can be hit.",0,3188343

Good point, companies always want to save money and IT and Networking is also a part of that so it's a part of the higher IT management to convince the ones that sit on the money that high IT security is very important.

My own company had a huge attack last year and that was a big eye opener. Lots of money was poured into IT related stuff after that. But it would of course have been better to realize that before the attack. Now it cost huge amount of overtime money to fix the problems. My company is by the way located in many many countries around the world.",0,3188390

I have a Peugeot Boxer. We cannot communicate with the BMS system but so far was working. Now isn't working anymore. The motor wanted was starting but once we put the D gear on, it would try to run but soon after it will go back and stall.
I had a joung mecchanic working on Peugeot garage looking at it (privately) and managed to get the wheel to spin but, soon as the van was again on ground, it seems there was not enough tork to get the van to move.
Any idea of what could be the problem?
Creg think is the inverter. 
Also, would you have any idea how to get the Boxer to communicate with the BMS?

The van is now at Greg's garage in Galashiels,
I believe he used a program called PuTTy.
He was able to get data with that program from my other van (Peugeot expert) but nothing from the boxer.

I don't want to break it and I would like to find the faults but I am concerned to get another inverter and then find out that's not the problem. Furthermore i would still have the problem with BMS system which is not communicating.

Any advice please?

Click to expand...

Not strictly true in the Allieds case.
The std type 2 has three lives used in three phase, one neutral, and Earth. As well as the two small pilot contacts.
To run on three phase the three phases on the allied are connected to the three phase pins on the Type2
The multi phase chargers used on the Allied is wired in a very non standard way, such that to run on single phase you dont connect a live and a neutral on the charger but two of the three phases, and one of these has to be connected to the neutral line to work. So if you have one wired to work on a three phase type 2 it wont work in a single phase outlet. But one wired to work an single phase (lower output) will work on any outlet.
To understand why the extra small pilot pins it helps to understand how the power outlets (not a charger as they are often refered to) work with an EV.
As the outlet sits there, even if you have turned it on (card, tag, appetc) there is no mains at the outlet socket or end of cable with the plug to go into your vehicle, (if its got a tethered lead) When you plug in the car (or into the car) one set of pilot pins detects the connection , and the other set respond to some simple communications between the car and the unit. These allow each to know what they can deliver. Ie if you have a 3kw vehicle, it will work on any outlet, but if you have a fixed 7kw vehicle, it wont be given power by a 3kw unit (It would simply blow its trip if you did). When all the handshaking is done, the power outlet is then turned on. If you unplug either end, the pilots are broken, and the mains is turned off.
Whilst we can make cables to adapt to these units to allow charging from Type two outlets, the handshaking is done in the plug, and so if you do disconnect the vehicle from the adaptor there is still power at the end of the cable. Not strictly as per the safety intentions behind 62196 /J1772.
A Type two inlet could be put into the vehicle and the handshake made , making the vehicle fully 62196 compliant, but the issue of the odd ball wiring with three and single phase of the charger would still exist. You could have a big red internal plug / socket that connects to the Type two inlet, and then simply insert a short cable with a plug and socket on the ends, that swaps the leads over so that the correct connections are made to the charger for single phase. A lot of faffing around but workable if you need access to public charge points, and want the three phase capability.",0,373958

I normally have 2/3 bars battery left out of 16 in winter and have had up to 4/5 in summer .

That route is quite harsh though, outbound it finishes in Fulwood in Sheffield which is at the top of a big hill. The M1/M18 is also quite hilly . 

When I travel from Doncaster to Wakefield on the a638 for example that's almost the ideal type of route for the Ion, 50ish and not too hilly. So then I'd reckon to do 60 miles with a sensible margin.",0,None

It seems we've both got the same sore of aims for the cars, I drive mine for my regular commute of around 17 miles out and 17 return journey a day. I'm in rural Dorset where there's a hilly geography and it's all country lanes and one or two 50mph main roads. I'm finding that I'm getting around the same 65ish mile prediction which is looking to be pretty accurate based on the miles I'm driving and the change in remaining miles along the various stop off points I make. my typical journey is using around 2 or 3 battery segments for each 17 mile trip. You will notice that once you turn the heater or AC on the range prediction drops by 10miles but returns when you turn it off. I've tended to use the heater as little as possible as a result and tend to drive with the windows open a crack once the screen is demisted. However I am going to have to look into some sort of dehumidifier as the car is getting misted up very quickly now that the colder damper weather has arrived.

I'm charging off a three pin socket with the 10amp charger that came with the car presently and it puts about 10miles an hour into the battery using this charger. I've got a Rolec 30amp type 2 on order with NuWorld Energy along with a Type2 to Type1 charge lead so that I can charge up at more charging stations when I get up the courage to start going on some adventures in the car. NuWorld are installing one charger per car with proof of ownership under the OLEV grant scheme.

So far I've mainly tended to drive the car very gently and it's fine though does make me feel I've joined the SAGA set. I did however test the car out the other day with an uphill overtake manoever and was pleasantly surprised at how I showed the Mercedese SL that was hassling me behind that a little car can be every bit as nippy in an overtake leaving him to stop hassling again. I also did a taintive spirited drive yesterday more akin to a 'gotta rush' drive and found the range was not badly affected by some ten miles of fun.

I'll be more comfortable with the car when I've got the 30amp charger installed meaning I don't have to pre-plan well ahead my car usage and exactly when I can slot in the required recharge to replenish the battery. (I'm not at the moment able to do overnight charging at my home as I need to get an outside electric socket installed as my drive is too far up the garden path to reach the plug without extension leads.)

I'm hoping I'll get the chargers installed shortly as I want to do a long run in the car to drop the battery well below the half way mark plus it is wise to do a full continuous charge up once a fortnight rather than lots of little top ups.

On the whole other than the demister/heater I'm pretty pleased with the car and I love the fact that I've not had to visit the petrol station this week and queue up to hand over ¬£45 to hook up to their pumps even if it's quicker.

Thank you for that information Edd it's handy to know and saves me scratching my head wondering when I get the charge points installed. I have gone for the 30amp with Type 2 socket so as to make the best effort to future proof the charge points and give me the greatest degree of flexibility.

The Mitsubishis are priced higher which seems to be because the Mitsubishi network is more confident that buyers will turn up and pay the prices. Most of the Citroens and Peugeots are priced to sell quickly. 

There are more spec variations on the iMiev, which has been on sale longer ‚Äì options like leather seats, sat nav included, etc. The gear selection is slightly more comprehensive compared to iOn/C-Zero, which only have one 'D' mode, in which regenerative braking is set fairly strong - equivalent to the 'B' mode on the Mitsu.

I can't make out any differences other than the subtle styling especially between the Citroen and the Peugeot. The main difference between the Peugeot and Citroen variants was that Peugeot only leased the cars new where as Citroen would sell them. The Mitsubishi does seem to be often shown having a few more gadgets e.g a sat nav and reverse camera plus it's often mentioned with a slightly more versatile gear selector where you can adjust the regen. These differences may however be for the US spec Mitsubishi as it is different. As far as range goes though I don't think there's any difference between the badges on that front at all.

I looked at the Leaf and was rather tempted by it at Christmas/New Year but I'm happy I saved the money and I prefer the simplicity of the iOn over all the gadgetry of the Leaf (Surprised myself on that front as I do like gadgets but in the Leaf they just seemed to be mostly bling, except for the clock, there's no clock in an iOn so you never know what the time is grrrrrrr) The Leaf is a bigger car too but as a commuter car the iOn is far more agile and easy to park. Range is much better on the Leaf though due to it's bigger battery. Best value iOn I'm aware of currently is ¬£7k for 4K miles on the clock with an 11 plate. Don't know about Leafs.....",1,59028

I find that too. When I've pressed on I have been surprised how little effect it has on range remaining. 

On Friday, I tried to empty the battery as much as I could over the last six miles of a motorway run before a rapid charge. Even at 70 mph, with the heater on full, it didn't hammer the range that much. Of course, if I had desperately needed to cover those last 12 miles you can bet that the miles remaining would have dropped like a NASA countdown! ",2,59127

Yep Tony that's the sort of deals you can get on the iOn at the moment and it seems like a good deal to me, so much so I bought one! 

First thing I'd say to anyone considering an iOn / C Zero / MiEV is the range is 60+ miles on a full charge realistically and that's in good weather. In the cold wet and dark you can drop that to more like 50 miles. If you're running around town all the time then no problem but if your regular commute is more than 20 miles or you want to go places other than your home region then it may be better to look at a car with more range such as a 2013 Leaf or a Zoe

I'm pretty pleased with my iOn and my only gripes so far are the lack of a clock to display the time. and the fact that the car windows mist up a lot. Other than that for less than ¬£8k I really can not complain about my car at all and I think it's an ideal introduction into driving an electric car and a superb runabout.",0,59108

The range you can get out of an EV is very variable dependant on where you drive, how you drive, and what the weather is like. I have a 2011 plate iON and I'm getting around about 60 miles predicted range on a full charge which is looking about right for my car on the journeys I do on a good day.

The things I've noticed that have a significant effect on the range are as follows :-

Heater, this takes out about 15 miles off the range when it's on if used the whole journey
Cold batteries can knock off close to 10 miles range if the temperature is cold ie close to freezing
Rain. In addition to having to try and keep the glass demisted in the car there's the windscreen wipers going plus the tyres are effectively pumping water off the tarmac all the time the wheels are revolving, think of this as like wading through a paddling pool or stream
Hills. I've found a significant difference in my range when I drive into Poole/Bournemouth which are on the coast and the terrain around them is pretty flat. Where I live it's reasonably hilly but I reckon that if I were to live around Bournemouth my range would go up 20 miles thereabouts. Remember that every hill you climb you have effectively lifted the car and it's content up the height of the hill which can be as much as 500 feet for rural Dorset
Change of speed. Accelerate very very gently, try to keep the power meter below the E of Eco for as much of your drive as is reasonable. Every time you use the brakes you are wasting energy. Even though there's regen on the iON it's only putting a small amount of energy back into the batteries for a few seconds at a time. Try and keep the car rolling at a constant speed. Not at all easy in rural country lanes even going round a bend in the road saps energy.
Are you getting a full charge? There's quite a bit of range hidden in that top bar on the battery charge meter. Leave the car plugged in overnight and check that the charging indicator lights actually go out. There's one on the dashboard that lights red plus there's one on the slow 10 Amp 'brick' charger. I find there's possibly about 7 miles hidden charge a bit like brimming the petrol tank in a regular car when you fill the neck as well as the tank.
I'd suggest trying different routes to Truro have a try going via Chacewater some day.

As for people getting 90 miles in an iON I'd say not a chance at all round the West Country, perhaps in East Anglia but not round here, where you live looks wose!",1,None

I always try to drive economically, not using more than the 'c' of 'Eco' and I put the car into 'N' on the downhill sections, except where I need to use regen to keep below the 30 mph speed limit.

Some days the C-Zero uses 10 miles of range on the way out but I can get back using only a further 2 miles of range. On Sunday I actually added 2 miles of range on the return leg.

I'm in two minds whether it's better to crawl up the hills at 35 mph, keeping the economy meter in the green, or give it a short burst of full throttle and then ease off into the green to carry more momentum into the next slight down slope. It doesn't seem to be clear cut.

For condensation, the key factor is to end a journey with the air inside the car as dry as possible.

Here is hoping that this thread is still alive and I find some active Peugeot ion/Citroen czero. I have just got myself a 2012 Peugeot ion and I am delighted with it. Got it mostly for the school run and delivering children to after school activities.

The main challenge with the car seems to be the heating and its impact on the range. I am wondering if any of your more experienced users could fill me in on the following:

Can the heater be turned on to heat the car while it is plugged in?
Does the heating work using a ""heat pump"" or direct electric resistance heater?

In our first winter, we used electric seat covers plugged into the cigar lighter socket. However, last autumn I didn't put them back in, waiting until they were really needed and we found that we didn't need them.

Our strategy is to wear what we would if going out for a walk. So jumper, top jacket/coat, woolly hat and gloves. The biggest challenge then is that the windows mist up. Using the fan on the demist setting without heat is effective in clearing condensation off the windscreen because the air coming in from outside has a lower relative humidity.

What we found is that there are very few days (in the south of England) when not using the heater is really unpleasant. Most days it's no big deal not using the heater, especially if your journeys are short. If you get complaints then compromise and turn the heater on.

We did try @misterbleepy's idea of plugging a convector heater in to warm up the car but found it wasn't really worth the hassle.

My point is that it's like any discipline, e.g. dieting or a fitness regime, unless you give it a go you won't really know. Of course, using a car's heater to demist the windows only guarantees that the windows will mist up again as soon as the car cools down. It's far more effective (and energy efficient) to get rid of all the airborne water vapour (generated by occupants exhaling) by good ventilation than to raise the temperature high enough for all the moisture to evaporate off the glass.

That depends on if it's an uphill out downhill journey but yes the battery gauge is a rough guide and the estimated range is really just a reflection of what the roads you just drove the last 10 miles along were like. Just keep gradually pushing your range. By the way both the heated and the air-conditioning sap masses of range but that's only whilst they are turned on so just use them for a minute at a time and make use of the wind down windows. A good warm coat is also strongly recommended

With careful driving trying to keep a steady 37 mph where possible I can get a regular 73 miles of real world range but this drops to low 60s in the dark of a were British winter. The key to good range is to try and keep the momentum going, so avoid traffic as much as possible even if it means taking a longer route. Slow road are recommended over fast ones

Yesterday was interesting. My wife left in the morning with the battery full and arrived home in the evening with it empty (no bars) and 2km left on the range. Thankfully she did not seem too stressed about it, probably because she has not appreciated what it will take if the car dies in the middle of the journey. Thursdays is the day that she puts most journeys on the car so it was the real test and it included:

Driving everywhere with the heating set to hottest and the fan at position 3. She commented that she did not have the heating on, so it must really produce so little heat that it is not worth putting on.
Driving in traffic. I though that this would not impact an electric car as much as an ICE car, but as commented above it seems to. I suppose that at least traffic does not put as much ware on an electric motor as an ICE.
A fair bit of the driving was done at night, so the lights would have been on. 
Having at least 2 people in the car, sometimes 3 and even 4. 
Thursdays are the days she does the most journeys, so if she managed it all with the heating on then we should be fine.

This experience has thrown up a few questions:

Does anybody know if there is anything left in the battery even once it gets to zero bars? Has anybody driven their car to a stand still?
Assuming there is some power left in the battery does driving it beyond zero bars have a detrimental effect on the battery or does the battery management system prevent it from going too low. 
We have not got a fast charging cable yet. One did not come with the car. Did any of you who bought the car new get one with it?
What is the consensus on how damaging to the battery using the fast charging points is going to be? 
Sometimes it is nice to put the foot to the floor to feel the acceleration of the electric motor. However I am guessing that putting a lot of torque on the electric motor is putting more strain on it than necessary. 

Since we live in Barcelona and the climate is somewhat milder I think that we have agreed that we can live without heating. Demisting the windscreen is not such a problem because it is not so humid here. Now, come the summer it may be impossible to live without air-conditioning, so that will be interesting to see. 

Thanks again for the support.",0,None

2. The battery management system will protect the battery from over discharge.
3. If you mean the cable to go into the charging port on the left side of the vehicle, the cable for that is permamently attached to the ChaDeMo charger.
4. I think that it is no more detrimental than regular charging - for example there is a taxi company near me who do nothing but fast charges (on their Nissan Leaf cars, so the batteries aren't exactly the same) and they have at least 1 car with over 100,000 miles on it which still has a useful range.
5. The motor should be strong enough to take the strain - there is no clutch or conventional gearbox to wear out and the transmission looks simple and strong.",0,None

In an ideal world the batteries should be neither fully charged nor fully discharged.

It is an Ansaldo motor/drive and it has a reputation for robustness, though Allied seemed to manage to degrade even that 'strongest part' by somehow introducing voltage transients within the system that seem to be able to trip the inverter up.

1. Does the motor still run through the original gearbox? 

2. Does the motor have comms? I'd expected it to be a dumb motor....?

I'm a plumber, working locally in Tunbridge Wells area and am sick of pouring ¬£100 into the tank every two weeks.. Was thinking the money saved on fuel would go a long way into building electric (not to mention I'd enjoy working on a conversion ) 

Unfortunately, the ENV200 is just too small for my needs, hence the conversion idea. The e-vito is 'apparently' appearing this year, but I'd have to wait a good few years before I'd justify the purchase of a depreciated used one! ¬£200/month on fuel savings would take a mightly long time to pay off the ¬£35k+

Hi there,
I wonder if you can help me with this.
I am new to Ev and I have purchased a Boxer and Expert ex Allied vehicle.

Expert diagnostic can be read and has few cell to be replaced on the battery

The Boxer is working but on the we cannot find the software to read the diagnostic.
I am afraid of potential future fault and how to resolve them If we cannot find the way to read the system.

I am thorn to keep it or selling it in case 
I will have some trouble in the future and not knowing how to deal with it.

Any advice please?

Hi Mike Its an Allied electric Peugeot Boxer van with the 55kw pack, yes I found the plug in centre console, and linked to my laptop, although it streams data, its corrupted, as I don't have the right software, but at least it links up, and new software should sort that out shortly. As they say, its an ill wind blows nobody any good, I contacted your place today, regards taking a look inside the pack, if the seller is sincere, he will be as anxious to resolve as much as me, and it is much easier having an independent pair of hands on board, plus it a bit closer, so less expensive to transport to you, rather than near London.",0,2493252

I am puzzled by this. Working in music studios and stage I have found anything but super cheap electronics to be 95% bomb proof. The five percent being mostly in appropriate abuse.

It's not that they are unreliable, it's just that when they do go wrong it's complete vendor lock-in with repair parts. No-one is going to aftermarket a drive inverter like they would an electronic throttle body or egr valve.

It's also the integration of the parts. With a simple EV drivetrain there are only a few parts, but these parts are therefor expensive when it comes to replacement time.",1,0

Where do you use it? In an indoor venue or by the side of the motorway in winter rain?

Back to connectors, the worst thing I see is corrosion on cheap tin plated contacts, when a gold plated version is available for a few extra pence. Even using the wrong crimp toll can cause prolems.

That's why I said about not protecting from water ingress. Not necessarily my gear, we didn't generally use it in the open rain but it can be in sub zero temps in plane holds, open air festivals getting bashed and kicked about. Festival PAs draw massive power as do multiple type A guitar amps and lighting systems, with a lot of heat thrown out. A circuit board is a circuit board and the weather makes a difference if the items are not sealed properly. Which is why I said about that being the manufacturers choice, they know this full well. If you expose circuitry to the elements it will fail very quickly. Apart from the transformers and old valve plates I don't think the high voltage actually makes it to the circuitry. I do get the bit about the connectors and leads though. Buggers in any field. You did say electronics didn't you?",0,2508174

Hi Dave, I have a Peugeot boxer and a. Expert from Allied. The Boxer was fully working until few weeks ago (16000miles) until decided to stop. 
The problem. Come from one of the 3phase who doesn't supply enough energy (I guess would be due to a failure one of the capacitor in the motor controller box).
A meccanich took the gear box away and we get the motor to spin as normal once the shaft is ""helped"" manually to kick star.
I haven't decided what to do it with it yet but I though to contact you just in case ...
How are you getting on with yours?

The battery pack is fully working and it has only this issue which I think is related to a 3 phase problem. The motor start and wanted to go but then it get kicked back. It will be a simple issue to the supply of the 3phase which is not allowing to create a start up of the magnetic field allowing the motor to start freely. At the moment if it's spinned manually, it start spinning no problem and respond to the accelerator by increasing or decreasing speed.
Marcb is suggesting to check encounters wires first and then the controller.

I'd be interested in the complete battery pack if you do decide to break it. Actually I'm quite tempted by the whole van... Yours has motor encoder problems doesn't it?

Hi there,
Actually ,I don't think that was the right diagnose. I have nbeenbyold that the encoder just invert electrical impulses into digital.
the van has been tow once when run out of battery charge.
The issue occured a week later the towing occurs.
Could it be that by being town, the rotor has lost its allinment between one of the 3 phases so that the magnetic field is not properly generate in order to push the rotor smoothly forward. It may just be that by repositioning the rotor in the right degree between the 3 phase, the motor won't kick back as it's magnetic field will be correctly restablished and therefore allowing the motor smotlty move forward. It will determine the smooth running of the wheel.
I am doing lots of studying on this but I don't have the time and the tools to work on it.",0,2812303

Hi Eddie, 
Thank you for your prescious advice. 
Ok. If seems that the encoder route is te most convencing and reasonable one to follow.
Yes, the motor drive the wheels when they are jacked up ...but not all the time.
I have a video of the motor rotating ok if ""helped"" manually. I could send it to you to give you a better idea.

At the moment the motor is kept at my mecchanic garage who will have a look at it soon as they start working again.
I remember that there was a red wire hanging but wasn't connecting anywhere On the plug connection were 4 wires.

When I removed the motor and trying to understand the issue, I did it with a apprenticeship mecchanic from Arnold Clark and we didn't have the tool to test the 3phase.",0,2814441

Hi there, 
Yes I think you are correct.
Yes, there was a red wire coming out from the motor that wasn't connecting anywhere. On the encoder plug connecting to the other wiring there were a 4 wire connection.
I am thorn if rather keeping this van and fixing it, selling it or brake it and using the component for a small electric car conversion project (reducing the existing battery pack and selling the remaining cell)
I have a Peugeot partner that has a cell problem and is getting fixed just now. I would rather keep that one as it's smaller and therefore more versatile and easy to move around.
I am not sure how much to expect from the sell of the boxer money wise.
At the moment the gearbox is out too as at the beginning a apprenticeship mecchanic from Arnold Clark though that the ""kick back"" of the motor could have been caused by a faulty gearbox. 
The gearbox turn out to be faultless.",0,2815284

Personally I would keep it and fix it. They don't rust, have a low floor height, and with some work and investment can be made into a decent van. The batteries are strong, with the addition of orion or similar bms that supports chademo you could have a really practical van.",0,2815566

I recently installed a ZEVA BMS and use it on a 14s home built home energy storage solution using nissan leaf cells, 3 in parallel 14 in series. They can also do far more cells with boards that daisy chain using CAN. It is very good. Accurate, easy to install, and reasonably priced.

Hi Mike.
Hope your well.
We are looking for some BMS parts for a Peugeot partner tepee allied.
We took ours in just for a health check on the cells and battery box.
Never having had the chance to look in there at all.
And wanting to know that our cells were ok.

And he found that all the cells were ok no swelling or leaking or bad cells thank goodness.

What he did find tho was, that every other cell is a perfect alternate voltage to its neighbour!
3.2/3.4/3.2/3.4/3.2/3.4 and so on like this throughout the whole pack.

A. Should this be like this??
B. If not what is causing it?
Is it the BMS? Maybe something has fried or burnt out?

He thinks all the cells should be the same voltage.
Is he right in thinking this?

He asked us to find out from someone who knows about these cars.

So your the man who knows......

Please can you help?

(Which will drain a lot sooner than the traction battery when not being topped up as it has to run the power steering, heater blower etc)

Without seeing a video of the dashboard when the car is turned on to see if there is a warning light or an attempt to charge it there's no way to tell if this car has this particular fault or whether the 12v battery is just flat from lack of use. (These cars do not maintain the 12v battery when the car is out of use - it will go flat after a couple of months of inactivity)

This OBC failure (two blown disc capacitors in the OBC and a blown 20 amp fuse in the MCU) is often repairable - I repaired mine, but there are variations on this fault that can be more difficult to repair depending on how much damage is done during the initial fault.

Try both to make sure you can get comfortable, also check out the ride quality, I think the Peugeot has been criticised for having a crashing ride quality at slower speeds, where as the LEAF having a longer wheel base delivers okay in this department.

What range are you planning do? The LEAF is good for 100 miles range worst scenario, if you want to do more than this on a daily basis without recharging, then the Peugeot need serious consideration.",0,None

Hi, ive got the opportunity to get a new Leaf 40nconnecta via my work leaf scheme at but I could get the Peugeot 2008ev for ¬£30 more per month. looks wise I prefer the Leaf as the 2008is a bit flashy for me. However I am aware that the 2008 has a 50kwh battery and 100kw charging. What do people think - is the 2008ev worth modest extra monthly cost or is it likely to be fairly similar to the leaf in terms of tech/safety/range?

Thanks

Click to expand...

They are very similar in size, but the Peugeot has more room if you need to transport things. Personally I'd get the Peugeot because of the Nissan's lack of telescopic steering wheel, so it can not be moved in and out, only up and down. My wife has a 40kWh Tekna since over a year, she is OK with it but I don't like driving it because of that. I feel it is very uncomfortable for me, so I try to drive it as little as possible. Also, it's a bit of apples and oranges, the Nissan is older than the Peugeot you compare with, which also speaks for the Peugeot. What speaks against is that the Nissan is reliable, they have experience in EV and is NOT made in France, if the Peugeot is made in France... Personally, after having had several French cars in the past, I'd avoid those. The Nissan is Made in UK, which was one reason why we chose that back in December 2008. Regardless of which consider a wall box as well. I'd not buy any EV without that.

Anyway, good luck. Not easy to buy the first EV.",0,None

Am I right in thinking that on a 50kW charger, the 2008 would pull the full 50kW for much longer before ramping down. The Leaf on the other hand would never draw the maximum 50kW and would ramp down much quicker?

So even with 50kW chargers the Pug would be better. And no doubt a lot more 100kW chargers will be installed in the years to come. Current providers of >100kW charging:

Ionity 69p/kWh
Instavolt 35p/kWh
E.ON Drive 43p/kW
Shell Recharge 39p/kWh
Fastned 39p/kWh
Alpha Power 25-33p/kWh
BP Polar 20-40p/kWh

THe e2008 has active battery cooling while LEAF is passive. It also has a larger battery, which implies a larger ""C"". If both batteries can charge at 2 * C, the e2008 can take more current since C is larger. 

That makes a difference on long trips with multiple stops for rapid charging. We know that LEAF throttles. LEAF is 50kW nominal max and the Peugeot is 100kW nominal max.

LEAF never gets to 50kW, even without throttling. The e2008 probalby won't get to 50kW from a 50kW charger either. It depends on pack voltage and the rapid's true maximum current. 

I expect LEAF will ramp down earlier than the Peugeot.

Hi,

I am trying to plan a route for my wife and 4 year daughter who are travelling from Manchester to G42NQL, it's the first time travelling on the Motorway with an EV and want to make sure they don't run into any trouble. Can anybody recommend a route or the best way to plan this, the car claims 219 miles but I would say we get about 190. Prefer to charge it when it has about 50/60 miles left just to be on the safe side. Also don't mind going down the Insta volt route just to save journey time.

Thank you.

To be fair 130ish is the range the Peugeot quote you should expect for normal 70mph driving on a 20¬∞C day on their website. Slowing down helps, but the 'base load' is pretty substantial and scaling is <V^(-2).

The journey I mentioned above from Luton to Inverness I did in a 21 plate Citroen e-C4. I mostly did 65mph on the motorways and where traffic and speed limits permitted on the dual sections of the A9. The rest I would be at or just below the limits, traffic permitting. I had music playing through Apple Car Play and I used the climate controls as necessary. I left home with 100% charge, did 4 charges on the way north, Keele, Burton in Kendal, Abington and Perth and arrived at the AirBnB I was using in the center of Inverness with 23%.

i did some driving about and a couple of charges in Inverness before I left to come back home. I left Inverness on 79% and charged at Pitlochry, Perth (shirt charge while having lunch) Hamilton, Killington Lake. And Keele. Same use of music and climate and average 3.9m/kWh.

Hey guys,

Already driving my new e208 GT for a month now and never going back to an ice vehicle (at least not buying one myself)
But I have been wondering if it's possible to lower the car a bit? The cornering doesn't stick so wel in the corners then my previous car (Opel Corsa E 3d OPC with sport suspension) and cosmetic wise it's ugly too. Can fit a whole fist between the arches and the tire instead of 3 fingers, I know I will sacrifice the comfort but imo I rather have a better handling car then a bouncy castle.

Is it the same as the ice variants? The extra weight has to be a factor to consider right?

Any car can be lowered. It's just norm coils I'm assuming

Hi everybody!

I am entering the world of EV ownership tomorrow with the purchase of a 2015 Peugeot ION. It's my first electric car and I was just wondering if anyone had any useful tips for me?

Also it is only coming with a 3-pin home charger. The dealer seemed to suggest that this would be fine and I'd never need to use public charges given that I won't be doing many miles with it. But I don't like the idea of not having the option. Do you agree with him, or me? Also from a real beginners perspective I'm unsure of which cable I should be buying if I were to get one?!

Thanks in advance!

The granny cable is really not meant to be used long term - it's really intended for short term or emergency use. You'll be much better off getting a proper charge point installed because it'll be faster, easier and more convenient - and if you have a mixed-rate electricity tariff (where the electricity is cheaper at certain times of day) you can schedule charging to only those times of day when the electricity is cheaper.

I have discharged the car once already as outlined above, this went fine but I don't think it improved the mileage at all, so perhaps the dealer had already had the foresight to do this before sending it to me. But I will keep up with this every couple of months.
In terms of the OBD app, it looks a little intimidating to me to be honest, but maybe I'll pluck up the courage to give that a go at a later stage. 

As mentioned last time I was looking out for a lower cost second hand charger and was initially looking at tethered ones as the type 1 tethered seemed reasonably priced, plus convenient for just pulling up and plugging in.

Then I realised that that would require me to be parked closest to the house every day. We have two cars and quite often I'm closest to the road, not the house. With the granny cable we have had to keep moving the cars round as required. So my second plan was to get a longer coiled wire and an untethered charger. I found a simple one on Amazon for ¬£230 from Qubev and when I went to order it, got a ridiculous offer for ¬£100 off if I sign up to an Amazon business Amex card (no account fees in first year). This seemed too good to be true, but I thought I'd apply and sure enough got ¬£100 off right away! So a home charger for ¬£130! Never had something fall into my lap like that before!!!

My brother in law just fitted this today for ¬£60, so a complete bargain!

Very happy!









I've also had a stereo and reverse sensors fitted which are linked to your phone, so the car now has a full display (my phone). To those thinking you don't need reverse sensors in a small car like this, which is what all my family are saying, you haven't seen my parking!










In terms of the car itself, I'm really loving it so far. So nippy and quiet - a real pleasure to drive.
My usual journeys are short distances, but I've been purposely going longer distances to sort of practice for when those occasions may occur, and have been using zap map to scope out charging points. So far I've learnt an important lesson, which is to plan to go somewhere with several chargers - not just one!

Hello people,
So I made my first proper jump to EVs, ordered an Orange e-2008 GT premium, dealers expects it in 2 months.

Drove the car a couple of times, it's a good drive and decent for the price I feel.

Not super enthusisatic on the slow performance (by Ev standards) and the rather short battery range, but have a tight parking space (with a charger) so would struggle with something like a Tesla.

Would appreciate thoughts and feedback from owners or people who considered it and bought somethign else instead. I know the Hyundai/Kia have better ranges but the design reallly doesn't do anything for me.

Thank you!

Most 3-pin plugs are not up to task. You need a plug on a dedicated circuit. 

Extension leads are unsafe with EVs. The 3-pin EVSE (charge adapter) that comes with most EVs have temperature sensors in the plug. They shutdown if the plug or socket overheats.

Extension leads don't do that.





Much better if you installed a proper 32Amp EV charge point on a dedicated circuit.",0,2807489

That really depends on where you are and what charging networks you use. Some chargers will cost as much as 39p/kWh. Some others are completely free to use, with plenty of others somewhere between. If you have a lot of Polar and/or CYC charging stations in your area, I'd suggest signing up to Polar Plus as you discovered yourself to keep the costs fairly low, and then trying to stick to just them as much as possible.

The car dealerships are pretty much the one exception to what I said about anyone being welcome at charging stations. You'll generally only be welcome to charge there if it's your manufacturers dealer. Some have fair use policies too.

I don't think you actually mentioned where abouts in the country you are yet. There are a lot of variations of networks depending on where you are. If you're willing to disclose that it will be easier for someone with local knowledge to give advice on what's best where you live. 

Most of the companies will require you to sign up for membership and either get the app or a RFID access card/fob. Some are thankfully starting to accept credit card payments now though. 

Unfortunately, with the current state of things you tend to accumulate a lot of memberships especially if you travel a lot like I do. Thankfully most are either free or inexpensive to sign up to, and simply take a direct debit for your actual usage, rather than paying monthly for membership, with the notable exception being Polar Plus - which can still be worthwhile if you live in an area with lots of Polar or CYC chargers that you will use frequently. 

Ecotricity/Electric Highway is one to join if you will ever be charging at motorway services or IKEA stores. They install most of the chargers at these locations. 

Pod Point is typically the app you need for charging at supermarkets. Most Tescos and Lidls have them now. You'll also find them at many shopping centres. 

Chargepoint operate the Instavolt network. They have very reliable chargers which are popping up all over the place. You can get a membership like mine, but they do take credit card payments directly if you prefer. You'll often find them at Jet petrol stations, KFC, a few regional supermarket chains, and Bannatyne gyms for example. 

Polar/CYC is one of the biggest networks. As well as working with most local councils to install in public car parks, city centres and the likes, they are also found at Holiday Inn, some BP Forecourts and many ASDA stores around the country. 

As I mentioned, if you can tell us where you are, it will be a little easier to advise exactly what is worth signing up to and an idea of what you may have to pay to use them.

Click to expand...

An EV is hard on a 3 pin socket. If it is more than a few years old, it would need to be replaced with a new one. Anything in less than perfect condition might heat up to the point where it catches fire. 

The 3-pin EVSE that comes with an i3 has a temperature sensor at the plug. It will shut off before it becomes unsafe. Peugeot probaly has this too. Not sure. I don't know if anyone here has an e2008 yet.


A better option would be to install a proper charge point. At a minium you would need a 16Amp circuit out to the garage. Cost is something like ¬£500-¬£700 including installation. Depends on how much work needs to be done and if you can manage to take advantage of the grant.

Charging away from home or work is not as reliable as it needs to be. Public chargers can be in use, blocked by a petrol/diesel car, or broken. Many of them use an unreliable app for payment.

They are all different. Anywhere from free to ¬£7.85 a month. A couple of networks take a rolling ¬£20 credit that you draw down.

Tariffs vary a lot. Typically I pay 2-3 times what it costs me to charge at home.

That is entirely dependant on where you need to charge and what kind of car you drive. There are many networks and four or five different rapid charging connectors/protocols.

The first few years of production are unreliable and expensive to repair. Each year is incrementally better. The 2018 facelift was a big overall improvment.

The i3 is quirkey and takes a little getting used to. Build quality is very high. The interior uses very high quality materials with odd touches. Mine has a beautiful solid eucalyptus dash floating in a sea of recycled portaloo. The front seats are very comfortable. Getting in and out of the back is fine but you have to open the front doors first. Rear seat passengers can't get out by themselves.

The base sound system is dismal. The upgraded H/K system is ok but nothing special. THe i3s is fast, especially off the line. Handling is good. The standard i3 isn't bad either but can get busy at high speed while the 's' is more planted. Ride is firm but comfortable.

A far better idea is to get a 32A CEE socket installed (as stated already)",0,None

ABRP (A Better Route Planner) is generally regarded the best app for journeys in EVs. Or there's a more simple planner built in to Zap Map. 

To answer your question from the earlier post, yes. It's probably a Holiday Inn I assume? You can go to the hotel and plug in to charge just fine, using a Polar Plus card or the Polar Instant app. You'd be using the CCS connection of the 3 you mentioned for rapid charging if you go for an i3 or 2008. Just head to the reception desk after plugging in to sign in to avoid any parking fines. If you let them know you're charging an EV you shouldn't be expected to pay for parking. 

It may be worth discussing with your dad to see if he would be open to a charge point install, if you think that's realistically how you will do the majority of your charging. Because without a 7kW install, I don't think it would be worth going there for the purpose of plugging in at all, and would be better getting a cable cover and using the 3-pin at home, or relying solely on public charging. 

Norfolk in general isn't terrible for EVs, but definitely not as many charging places as there are around me. There seems to be a lot of different networks in the area, but Polar definitely seems to be a good place to start going by a quick look at the map, and then consider joining others if you discover some other network's chargers to be especially local to you or along some of the routes that you frequently travel.",0,2807826

Probably not. Most of the Polar Hotel chargers need you to sign up. Even if you don't Polar Instant is less expensive than contactless. If you use it often enough, Plus is cheaper.

With most hotels you need to go the front desk and let them know. Otherwise you might get a parking fine.

I don't know if anyone here has an e2008 yet.


I've been leasing a 2018 i3s for about a year. The i3 is a marmite car. I like mine a lot but others really hate it. BMW have substantially improved the i3 since it came out in late 2013. The first few years of production are unreliable and expensive to repair. Each year is incrementally better. The 2018 facelift was a big overall improvment.

The i3 is quirkey and takes a little getting used to. Build quality is very high. The interior uses very high quality materials with odd touches. Mine has a beautiful solid eucalyptus dash floating in a sea of recycled portaloo. The front seats are very comfortable. Getting in and out of the back is fine but you have to open the front doors first. Rear seat passengers can't get out by themselves.

The base sound system is dismal. The upgraded H/K system is ok but nothing special. THe i3s is fast, especially off the line. Handling is good. The standard i3 isn't bad either but can get busy at high speed while the 's' is more planted. Ride is firm but comfortable.

The car is easy to park and manouver in tight spaces.

SatNav and iDrive work well but have a bit of a learning curve. - The entire car does. I suggest reading the manual all the way through.

i have to disagree with Andrew about the rear access. We were in our mid 70s when we leased our i3 4 years ago, and getting a bit creaky. We found the rear was slightly difficult to get into, but neither of us could get out without assistance from outside. Don‚Äôt know what the OP‚Äôs age is, but with a 92 y o Dad, might be wise to try it in the showroom first.
Talking of the showroom, we were in the same boat as the OP, unable to charge at home. Although we leased our car we asked for it to be delivered via our local BMW showroom, who then allowed us to use their bank of 7kw charging points during opening hours, accessing via a polar card with free electricity. Might that be an option for the OP? I used to drive to the showroom, about 3 miles away, put the car on charge, go home on the bus for 4 hours and then return on the bus.",0,2807798

Well I emailed the hotel and as it's a private owned hotel and I live locally, there is no issues with using the charging point. I am able to just pop in and use it whenever I would need to.

The heat is almost instant in an EV. Far faster than a diesel or petrol car unless they have electric heat (some do)

With an i3 you can set a departure timer that warms or cools the car as needed. That mainly is for use where the car is plugged in. It also can warm the battery which helps range but only if the car is plugged in to a real charge point. The battery heater doesn't work with a 3-pin plug.

I purchased my e208 in October '21 as an 18 month old car (registered March 2020). Had a low mileage of 4k miles and a stamped service book (1st year 12 month service when it had 2.8k miles) from a Main Dealer not local to me but not too far away - maybe 40 miles or so.

All well and good - and as a March 2020 car I assumed it would need it's next service in March 2022.

Clicked the ""Vehicle check"" button the other day and it said Service due in 3 months or 11,000 miles - so all good.

Looked in the Peugeot App and it gave me some unintelligible timeline with a red cross next to where a ""first service"" should have been undertaken at 4,800 miles (It's now done 4,900).

I called my local Peugeot Main Dealer (2 miles away) and asked what the situation was and if it's due a service at 4,800 miles (I recall reading somewhere that there was an issue whereby 8,000km was used as a service interval) or if I am ok to wait for March.

The local main dealer confirmed it was due a second service in March 2022 (brake fluid service apparently for 294 quid all in) but in order to set that up he needed all the vehicle info so he could add the car to their database as currently it didn't show up on their systems. I said that it was serviced by the supplying main dealer at year 1, but he said that as they were a different chain of main dealers he had no access to any of the vehicle records and couldn't tell me if the first service had actually been done or not or if any recalls were needed or had been done.

I thought the whole point of digital service records and connected car Apps was that all this data was now available to (at least) main dealers and proper independent garages and that this was a selling point for digital service records so that you couldn't get scammed with dodgy service book stamps etc.

What's the point of having all this data stored digitally if the app doesn't match what the car needs and the main dealers can't see each others records? The app certainly doesn't seem to be able to show me any service history (Should it?)

I love the car - but find the App to be pretty hopeless.

Click to expand...

It's 4,970 miles = 8000 Kilometers. Ours requested 1st service at that mileage after 6 months and I had it reset to 8000 miles by Peugeot but the app shows the service as being missed and has never caught up with reality.",1,None

I'm whizzing about in an e-208, and absolutely loving it. I had a podpoint installed as Peugeot were subsidising them when I ordered, and it has been a faultless experience. In my experience, the PSA Group subforum here on speakev seems more active than the owners club forum and it benefits enormously by being a place where Stellantis drivers share knowledge and opinion all in one place (as many of the groups cars share the same quirks and workarounds, it seems).

No it's nothing to do with safety/etc - it's for locating a very specific load/carrier which uses (bolts into) the anchorage points but needs at least two seperate ones in the middle of the car. They can be retro fitted but it's much less hassle if they're already there.",0,0

Greetings,
I feel its almost time to swap my vito sport x dualiner (22500 miles 58 reg) for an electric van.
Ive never been one for going to dealers test drives etc, I just like to find out whats available and will it do the job?
As my van is so little used(every other week 20 miles to cut parents grass plus odd venture) i feel a small petrol or electric should do the job has anyone tried out/ compared above.I like the idea of three seats (pug/ cit) as it will be school transport when leaf goes back( unless another great deal comes in) (I thought a citan 1.2 trav might do but merc dealer never got back to me!!) leads me onto a kangoo ze ( cheap to buy used) can get a cheapish battery rental for low mileage but what are the electrics like long term? The leafs appear to be reliable so far , plan to keep van 7 years . has anyone converted a leaf into a more useable estate/van / pickup?-just need to get mower and strimmers etc moved. I may need to remove bulkhead and install a rear seat-env200has anyone done that yet?
lack of timer on the pug/cit puts me off plus generally bit smaller capacity but i suspect ride may be better??
Any info appreciated.
Thanks Al

After a 6 week wait, Zen Auto delivered a shiny new e208. As a first dip into the ev waters, I am pretty impressed. The only other ev I have driven is an electric go kart and that and the e208 have some definate similarities! I was a bit concerned when it arrived with an almost full charge and showed a range of just 111miles. However, I am half a charge down and it looks like it will be around 150miles- not brilliant, but what was expected. The only thing I wish I could change is the volume and tone of the parking sensors. When I park on my drive, the 'you're way too close!' tone is at a pitch that goes right through me. I haven't found an option in the car's setting to change it yet, but I'll keep looking. What do other e208 owners think of their car?

Why ?

The difference between the two is relatively small. Mainly lower internal resistance of the later cell and supposedly reduced degradation rate.

The BMS knows how to cope with moderate increases in internal resistance as internal resistance nearly doubles between 20C and 0C in normal operation and as cells degrade their internal resistance goes up significantly as well.

They're still the same basic chemistry and voltage curve AFAIK, just a modest refinement in the design mainly aimed at reducing degradation rates. The datasheets of both are available online if you want to compare them.",0,3214535

I have, and spent time translating the full japanese reports.

The characteristics of the LEV50N are significantly different to the LEV50 in charge tolerance with temperature and remember that the BMS firmware was replaced when the newer cells were loaded in - this is the critical factor - there's a possibility that a LEV50N-programmed BMS may attempt to push a LEV50 past safe limits, particularly on rapid chargers. It could be akin to mixing different construction 18650 cells in a cordless drill pack (I've seen it done, resulting in a ¬£500k workshop fire)

This is the kind of thing where insurance companies start getting tetchy and voiding policies. The last thing anyone needs is bad publicity about an EV going up in smoke at a rapid station (and potentially losing liability cover, then having insurers start clamping down on repacks, which hurts everyone)

Because Mitsubishi played secret-squirrel with their coding we just don't know what the risks are of mixing older chemistry cells in newer chemistry packs. Yuasa's Japanese reports are useful but vague in this area and they have not responded to direct requests for information or risk assessments. I'll guarantee that no thought was given to the possibility that anyone would mix'n'match a few years down the line and any assumption that ""what's safe for LEV50N is safe for LEV50"" is dangerous (it's the kind of attitude that let space shuttles fly with leaking booster o-rings because ""there haven't been any incidents"")

One of the Russian enthusiasts (Nikolay Fadeev - kolyandex of MMCcoder fame) has managed to work out how to directly reprogram BMSes (and has done so to allow NMC repacks to be safely used. The Australian repacks are using an extermal MITM module built by Franciso Shi).

It's probably time to start reverse engineering BMU programming over several model years and see how it evolved (the EV-ECU and BMU controllers are used extensively in several late 90s Mitsubishi ICE vehicles, so are already relatively well-known items. There's a small industry revolving around reprogramming the BMU module in its Lancer and EVO ECU guise)

LEV46 all use the newer chemistry (ie: they're N cells). The reason there are so many LEV40s floating around is because there were a lot changed out of older Overlanders - smaller batteries in a heavier vehicle with plenty of deep discharges means they degraded even faster than original LEV50s",0,3214571

Yeah, what you trying to achieve isn't necessary on modern batteries. There is also a need to top up to 100% occasionally to allow the BMS (Battery Management System) to balance all the cells in the battery pack. This does more to keep the battery healthy than always charging to 80%.",0,2865497

Please stop repeating the same old ill informed wives tales. Nothing has changed in the cell chemistry in ""modern batteries"" in relation to the degradation effects of sitting at 100% charge. It's still not good for them, just like it has always been. For some reason EV drivers seem to keep buying the same old BS that some car manufacturers spout when they say there is no benefit to having a charge limit option. Instead of listening to the car manufacturers who don't offer a charge limit option justify their position, go and read a research paper on cell degradation and form your own conclusions.

Also, ask yourself one question - which brands of EV's have the longest lasting batteries ? Do they have adjustable charge limiters and even recommend their use ? (Answer, yes they do)



There is also a need to top up to 100% occasionally to allow the BMS (Battery Management System) to balance all the cells in the battery pack. This does more to keep the battery healthy than always charging to 80%.

Click to expand...

You seem to be confused between cell degradation and cell balance, and lump them both under ""battery health"". Cell degradation is a permanent and irreversible loss of capacity of the cells (and often an increase in internal resistance) while cell balance is simply the current state of charge of all the cells relative to each other.

While it's true that a large cell SoC imbalance can temporarily limit the usable capacity of the battery until re-balanced, it would take a large imbalance over many dozens of charge cycles before even a negligible reduction in usable capacity was noticed, is not harmful to the battery at all, and completely reversible simply by letting the car complete a few 100% charge cycles. Unlike degradation which is permanent and irreversible.

So, no, regular balancing at 100% does not do more to keep the battery healthy than using a charge limiter - quite the opposite.

Also keep in mind that most EVs don't do any cell balancing during DC rapid charging - it's not feasible to balance during a rapid charge as the charge rate is too high relative to the bleeders in the balancing system and the charging duration too short to have any meaningful impact. (Level 2 charges typically spend 30-60 minutes at the end balancing without charging which does not happen on a rapid charge)

By your line of reasoning any EV that was charged largely or exclusively by rapid charging and never got to see a 100% Level 2 charge would have poor battery health due to being unable to balance the cells, but you don't see manufacturers warning people not to charge their car exclusively by rapid charging.

I agree that the occasional 100% charge to fine tune the balance is not a bad thing, but once a month or so should be adequate. Healthy cells shouldn't get out of balance in the first place.",5,2865619

Rapid charging is worse for the battery than slow charging.
Keeping a Li-Ion battery at 100% for extended periods is bad, and charging to 100% is worse than charging to less than 100%. However, what your car treats as ""100%"" is not actually 100% so it really isn't a big deal.

TLDR:

Wasn't talking about degradation whilst 'sitting' for a long period. Was talking about it's okay to charge to 100%. It's definitely an Old Wives Tale that you should never ever charge to 100%. It's okay with sensible usage. I charge my MG to 100% about twice a week, because I use that amount of juice in day to day running.

I agree on all the points DBMandrake has made. There are lots of articles, papers, internet sites etc. that tell that story.

Avoid fast charging. Slow charging at home is best if you are lucky enough you can do this.
The e-208 does have a heat pump to cool the battery. That helps. Fast charging on a Leaf or a Zo√´ is much worse.

Keeping the battery charge between 20% and 80% of capacity will help battery health. 
Note that most EV manufacturers today do provide a ""buffer"", meaning that ""0%"" is not ""battery completely empty"" and ""100%"" is not ""battery completely full"".
The e-208 has a 50kW battery with a 5kW buffer, so only 45kW (80% of capacity) of the battery capacity can be used.
That means with the e-208 you do not need to be too stressed out about the 20% - 80% window.
A 20% - 80% capacity use window is 60% of capacity, mind you. Not 80% as set by the buffer. So it is still good practice to not use the 0-100% indicated capacity if you do not really need it.

But you can use the car's full range if you need to:
It does not harm a lot to charge to 100% and drive the car for a long trip right after that.
It does not harm too much to empty the battery to e.g. 5% and charge it right away. But this is not without consideration: after a long trip the battery may be hot and charging it while hot, specifically on a fast charger, is also not good for the battery. Let the battery cool for a while first. 

If you intend to leave the car without use for an extended period (2 weeks vacation...) leave it at about 50% charge.
Now for how to limit the charge to 80%. We own an e-208 since May 2021.

It is not for everybody, but the ""OpenEnergyMonitor"" guys from the UK provide a modified European kit for the OpenEVSE charger. I built one and I am happy with it. It is not entirely without issues though. The key points are:

Control over WiFi with OpenEVSE app on phone or webpage on computer.
You can set the maximum charge on a charge session, e.g. 30kWh. The current firmware has a bug that will cut the charge at 12kWh regardless, it is being worked.
You can set the max. charge current, e.g. 10 Amps.
You can set a charge timer, so you can calculate how long you need to reach 80% and set it to cut at that time.
It has more features if you want to be more advanced. It has MQTT on board so you can do ""Solar PV Divert"": use your solar panels to charge the car and not pull current from the grid for this. My next project is reading the import/export power from my smart utility meter using a RaspberryPi4 and control the charge current with MQTT to do this. The OpenEnergyMonitor guys have a package for Solar PV Divert too, but it requires installing measurement coils and can not use the DSMR smart meter yet.

It will get better still: there is a beta version reading the EVs SoC (State of Charge, e.g. % battery charge) and the plan is to have a settable SoC.

All this is not for everybody. I believe it is only a question of time before you will be able to have this stuff in standard packages like with the ""Wallbox"" charger offerings. Or you can buy a Tesla and not worry about any of this .",2,None

Hey guys,

Proud owner of a black Peugeot e208 GT, but for the life of me I can't find how to set the max charging to 80%... It always charges to 100% unless I keep an eye on it, but since I'm charging overnight it's hard to do that.
Looked everywhere on google, youtube, reddit etc and the customer support and dealer are no help either.
Since I'm planning to keep this little rocket for a while, I want to keep the battery in top condition.
It's running on the latest updates as firmware wise.

Thank you

Correct about the buffer, but I've always heard the battery is 50kWh and the usable capacity is 45kWh because of the buffer. This you can find on more than one source on the internet. Could you divulge your source? I'm curious.

Name: Unnamed: 0, dtype: int64",104600,"May 7, 2022","I found a way to automatically limit the charge to 80%. I'll admit straight off the mark that this is not for everyone. But then again, a bit of an IT enthusiast should not have any issues.

The application that allows you to do this is the GitHub - flobz/psa_car_controller: control a psa car with connected_car v4 api. Using android app to retrieve credentials.

First you need a home network and a little computer that is on all the time. Like a server. This can be a Raspberry Pi, really cheap, or it can also run on Windows, Linux or inside Home Assistant as an addon. The key is the machine is always on.

In my case it is a Synology NAS capable of running Docker. Mine is a DS220+. I loaded the app in a docker container, initialized it (you need the password or pin you use for the myPeugeot app on iOS or Android to access the Stellantis servers). Once it is up and running, you can set the maximum charge limit by entering this http request in your computer or laptop browser:



http://localhost:5000/charge_control?vin=YOURVIN&percentage=80



where you need to replace ""localhost"" with the IP address of your server, :5000 with the external port you configured for the application and YOURVIN with the VIN of your car.

That is it. The PSA_controller app will see to it that your car stops charging at 80%. I tried it and it works for me:










The above is the Terminal feed for this app. You can see the way the app does that. It tells the car to set itself to the delayed charge mode.
So you find the car with the little blue led indicator around the charge indicator on the car near the charge port.

I do not have extensive experience with this yet. I have a few questions, like: how can I charge to 100% if I want to? What happens if the delayed charge time is reached? Do I need to enter this command in my browser every time the car is plugged in? I still need to figure these things out.

Understand that this is not telling the car to stop charging at 80%. The car does not have the capability of doing that yet. It may in the future with an update of the software and if you ask me it is sorely needed. What I am proposing here is a patch. Another computer with another app, outside of the car, is watching the car charge and is asking the data from the Stellantis server continuously, forcing your car to publish a bunch of data to these servers on a regular basis. So yes: Stellantis will know you are putting a high demand on the service and like in my case, Stellantis will complain to you about that through the app by setting a little info message that you should not ask so much of the remote data because ""It is not good for the 12 Volt battery"". When the flobz app sees the car charge level is at 80%, it hits the ""delayed charge"" command which effectively makes the car's charger stop taking a charge.

So if you are on vacation and intend to leave the car on the driveway, it may be a good idea to stop the flobz app.",0,None

Kangoo has a 16A on-board charger. Lack of rapid charging is a real issue though.

Sounds about right.

Kangoo Z.E. is getting modest battery upgrade to 33kWh and the R60 motor. Renault say the real world range should be between 75 and 124 miles. This is up from Renault's estimate of 50 to 78 for Kangoo Z.E. Phase 2.

Still no rapid charging. We can blame the French post office for that. The 33kWh battery is going to take even longer to recharge at 16Amps. 

In my opinion Kangoo Z.E. is all around a better van than the eNV200. Lack of rapid charging puts it out off the running.

The Nissan is an excellent van but too big for my needs and also too expensive (rubbish SatNav reviews also didn't help). However to get the best of both worlds I ended up paying lower Nissan money due to supply and demand.

I think even with battery rental, at the price point and with rapid charging the Kangoo would be hard to ignore. As you point out increasing the battery size but remaining at a slow charge rate will rule out a lot of buyers.",0,None

I know it's a little late but I have a 2014 Partner Electric, so if you have any questions I'll be happy to answer them.
Currently this Winter I've been averaging 75 miles with no heating. The heating really does gobble the battery. Summer I can get to 90. All town driving.

There is a slight delay on pressing the peddle or lifting your foot off, only tiny but noticeable. I'm used to it now. The regen is heavy, one foot driving is pretty easy.

The drive/park knob isn't as good as the Leaf, you have to phisically shift it to park.

You can't sit with the heat on while charging which is a little annoying.

It has a type 1 (same as leaf) connector at the front right. Where the diesel cap should be is the chademo connector.

No pre-heat or de-frost also spoils the fun but it is a commercial vehicle and built to a price point so I didn't expect all the toys. I like the folding wing mirrors!

Current temperatures (-2 to 8 degrees) I'm getting 70-75 miles with heating on (see below) best I had in warmer weather 109 miles.

I find that if I have the heater on 3 or 4 squares and 1 whole fan blade then any miles lost on the GOM (a nice touch that it auto-adjusts with heater) are gained back with regen. Might be a useful factor of living in the hilly lake district? Having the vents on the floor also helps keep a nice warm cab and it suggests that fro winter driving in the EV supplement handbook/leaflet.

Added another power outlet (blanked hole already in console so no cutting required) for a heated seat pad, I can now power the dashcam and heat the seat at the same time. It also keeps my back/bum warm while charging. 

One more annoying thing I found is the ignition switches off after 20mins for '12v battery save' mode. This is an across the range Peugeot thing! Totally unnecessary on an EV but I asked and it can't be changed with the software (some earlier Peugeots can).

Not too sure how it compares to the nv200 as I've never driven one. At the time it was a price thing, and still is as I would only buy the new 40kWh version. Hard to compare as well as the NV200 is really the next van size up, the true comparison is the Kangoo and the Pug wipes the floor with that!

3 seats is still an issue as we often (nearly always) travel, me, the wife and our jack russel. 2 seats would be a pain (mostly on the wifes lap!)

If I do change at any point it will be either a battery upgrade on this or a 40 NV depending on prices at the time or if I'm so busy I need a bigger van.

I also believe the inverter may be covered, you should explore this, and you should stick to the position that they 'fixed' the wrong problem. Don't raise any discussion about how many more trips you ran, that gives them ammunition that it was OK. 

Just say 5 hours later it wasn't working, and when it went wrong it presented exactly the same error, so that proves they did it wrong.

They would need some pretty hard evidence to show it was otherwise.

Was the heating working before you took it in? Ask for them to show you proof the heater was defective, else you want your money back.

They (or the diagnostics equipment) have probably misdiagnosed a low impedance path in the inverter, falsely indicating it was in the heater.

Skelton can be a bit inconsistent, and I wonder why that is?

Sometimes on the way up, I get my cars max charge rate of 135kW, and then 2 days later on the way back I‚Äôm at 65kW. Both after a couple of hours driving and similar states of charge.

Its pretty typical in an EV that you'll get about 2/3rds NEDC range in summer and 1/2 NEDC range in winter. 

So based on Peugeots 93mile NEDC rating, i would expect about 60miles summer and about 45 winter.

Also bear in mind, especially in winter, 10 4 mile journeys will use significantly more energy than one 40mile journey. 

Dont forget, the same thing happens with petrol cars. They'll claim you'll get 47mpg, and you'll actually get 35, its still massively less, but you dont get the further reduction in winter as the cars heated with waste heat, and the tanks big enough that a 30% reduction in range doesnt actually matter.",1,None

The furthest I've taken it was ~70 miles [50mph max on the A1] late last year so still chilly.

Try not to use heater on longer trips relying solely on heated seat covers as they do nothing to range.

I don't normally take the car to it's limits as so many chargers around and all it takes is an unexpected event to really screw you over.

Sadly, the 93 mile NEDC figure is pure fantasy - just like all other NEDC range claims for all other EV's. (This is why the NEDC is no longer used, now its WLTP, however the Ion doesn't have a WLTP rating as far as I know - if it did it would be around 60-70 miles)

2/3rd of the NEDC figure is achievable in summer with no heater , a bit over 1/3rd in winter with full heater use. The US EPA rating for EV's is usually pretty spot on for summer driving and for the i-Miev it is 62 miles.

Your figures are in line with what I get on mine, or at least did, when I had a bit less battery degradation a couple of years ago.

My car now has approximately 78% state of health at 49k miles and on ""combined cycle"" driving (a mix of motorway and residential roads which I commute over) and in summer with no heater I'm getting about 55 miles, and winter below 0C ambient and heater about 35 miles.

At 28k miles the car did about 60 miles in summer and 40 miles in winter, so I've lost about 5 miles range due to further battery degradation in the time I've had it.

So even if your car had a new 100% state of health battery that would only correspond to 70 miles in summer and 45 miles in winter with heater use. I think this is the most you would ever see out of this car with ""normal"" combined cycle driving even when new.

The biggest cause of extra consumption in winter is the heater - the heated seat covers is good advice, I have heated seat covers on both front seats and it significantly reduces the level which you need to run the heater at to stay comfortable, this helps eek out a bit more range.

The heated seat covers can also stay hot (in ACC mode) when the car is being charged, while the normal heater can't be used while charging, so seat covers are really good for staying warm if you stay with the car during rapid charging!",1,0

I'm not sure that I can agree with that.

The LEV50N cells in the later cars are better but remember there are only 80 of them in an Ion/C-Zero compared to 88 cells in the older Ion/C-Zero like mine or the i-Miev. So 10% less capacity from new.

PSA claimed they achieved equal range by ""improving regeneration"", but to me that's doublespeak for ""we reprogrammed the ECU to increase the D mode regen to equal the B mode in the i-Miev"", eg the B mode which I've unlocked in my older Ion.

So brand spanking new, I doubt the new models would go 20% further than an old one, it's probably a bit less if anything. However, the real strength of the LEV50N cells is the (claimed) dramatically reduced degradation rate compared to the older LEV50.

So once the car has say 10-20k miles or a couple of years under it's belt the reduced degradation rate would mean that the newer car would retain more usable capacity and that as it continued to age the gap would widen. So you sacrifice a small amount of capacity when new, but retain a lot more usable capacity as the car ages.

If I could choose again I would probably go for a later car with LEV50N's for this reason, as I do a very high mileage and I'm already starting to see significant degradation on the early type cells beyond what the car already had when I bought it at 28k miles.

Click to expand...

Driving at a constant 20 to 30 mph would give very low consumption and easily achieve over 70 miles (in summer at least) however stop start London traffic will take it's toll on the consumption. I actually find a steady 50mph on the motorway has lower consumption than 30mph stop/start traffic where you are only driving one junction and then stopping again, even when making the most of regeneration to slow down.

It unavoidably takes more energy to constantly stop and start even if regeneration is recovering some of the kinetic energy while braking.



Interesting to know about the newer models - I will find out when it was actually manufactured as a start. 20% more would match what the salesman said at the time of delivery - that ""I'd get 83-85m, not 93m, out of it in normal conditions"". It was supposed to be made in March 2018 for delivery to me in April 2018 but might have been sitting in stock for a while. I'll find out.

Click to expand...

With the caveat that I have never driven a brand new example of these cars, I would say that the 83-85 mile claim is complete rubbish even when new.

You might achieve that if you did a constant 20mph never speeding up or slowing down, but you will never achieve that in stop start traffic nor on the motorway, so for all intents and purposes that is an unattainable figure.

Unfortunately you're far from the only person who has been given misleading information on what range an EV could do - back when the NEDC was still used it was common practice for dealers to make extravagant claims above the range an EV could do based on the NEDC figure, even though if you could manage 2/3rd of the claimed figure in summer you were doing well. (Let alone winter)

Nissan in particular got a bad rap for their extravagant NEDC based range claims with dealers making no attempt whatsoever to give ""real world"" range figures, thus a lot of unhappy customers who felt they'd been mis-sold, and it's hard to disagree with them.

Now that all new EV models have to be rated under the WLTP system things aren't quite as bad - although the WLTP is still ""optimistic"" it is within the realms of possibility if you drive carefully, whereas the NEDC was just a fantasy.

The Ion being an old model that predates the WLTP will probably never get a WLTP rating and continue to be sold based on the highly misleading NEDC figure. However as I mentioned the US EPA rating is 62 miles and that is pretty much on the mark.

If you're comparing range between EV's if the car is available in the US market always try to use the EPA figure as it is generally pretty accurate, and corresponds with real driving. Otherwise, go by the reports of other owners as to what they realistically get in their cars.

It's unfortunate that people need to be skeptical of manufacturers claims but that's where we are at the moment.",1,2524698

I've heard this claim before but seen no evidence of any significant reworking of the motor or drive inverter. I must check the part numbers for them in peugeot service box to see if they have even changed...



We are comparing a 2018 new Ion with a 2012 Ion so of course the range will be at least 20% better because even if the 2012 car had zero miles, the battery will have aged.

I was referring to the claim that when new range would have been 20% better on the newer cars - it won't have been, unless they've found a way to bend the laws of physics. Below 50mph these cars are already very efficient, and aren't that far behind the Zoe and Ioniq/Kona, and more efficient than many other EV's. (Above 50mph is another story though!)

I can achieve 170Wh/mile in 30mph stop/start driving without any real effort, there's not many EV's that can match that - Kona and Ioniq are some of the few that will better it in city driving efficiency.",0,2524712

On the other hand if rumours are to be believed, new Ion/C-Zero's have not been manufactured for many years now and PSA have been gradually selling off a stock of vehicles that have been holed up in warehouses for years now. In which case they WILL have age related battery degradation.

I'd love to see the Canion battery report for that ""new"" Ion to see what the Ah capacity actually is. Also in Diagbox you can find the date of manufacture in one of the ECU's. For example my 2011 Ion was first registered in July, but the date of manufacture is February according to the ECU, and also according to the RPO number - which is not printed on the car anywhere as is usually the case with PSA vehicles, but can only be found in Peugeot service box when looking up the VIN number.

Looking up the VIN number in Peugeot service box to find the RPO number then using an RPO number date calculator should reveal the true manufacturing date of the car. As RPO numbers are used to distinguish build date to obtain correct part numbers when there have been part number evolutions, (like the removal of the second gear lever switch) it can't be fudged, unlike first registration date.",2,2524746

As far as I know, leaving an intelligent 12v battery charger connected to deal with a flat 12v battery at the same time you plug the car in to charge the traction battery is perfectly OK, and that's what I did on mine in that situation.

You should find that once the car starts charging the traction battery you can actually remove the 12v charger as it will become self-sustaining, (the car will charge the 12v battery while it charges the traction battery, so effectively it only needs a ""jump start"") however if your traction battery charging session isn't very long (less than a few hours) it may not charge the 12v battery for long enough to get it fully recharged after being run down very low.

Replaced the 12v battery on my Ion just recently. (Discussed in another thread)

The car was still starting and running ""normally"" even when left for a few days between starts however I noticed that in accessory mode (where the 12v battery is not being charged, same as accessory mode in an ICE) it could only run my heated seat cover for about 8 minutes before the radio faded out and my dashcam turned itself off.  A healthy 36Ah battery should be able to provide that 3 amp load for over 10 hours, let alone 8 minutes...(and the longest I would ever run the seat covers with the car in accessory would be about 30 minutes - easy for a healthy battery)

After replacing it I did a capacity measurement of the old battery. With a 0.4A load it had a usable capacity of 1.4Ah, versus 36Ah for a new battery. Ouch. 

This goes to show how minuscule the demands of the car are on the 12v battery - standby current on these must be extremely low, and the ECU's are able to remain powered and engage the contactors with as little as 9 volts available.

Once the car is ""ready"" and the contactors are closed the heavy loads like power steering and brake vacuum pump are effectively supplied by the traction battery via the DC/DC converter so the 12v battery doesn't do much apart from provide standby power for central locking etc and provide contactor power to put the car into ready mode, and then only acts as a buffer.

Because the demand is so low on these, it appears the 12v battery can get really sick before any symptoms are noticed - my battery would not have had a chance to crank over an ICE in that state and would have long ago required replacement.

The battery has had one deep discharge in my 2 year ownership over a year ago, but on the other hand it looks like it was still the original factory fitted battery so almost 8 years old now, so I'll cut it some slack. Typical 12v battery lifespan in an ICE is only 3-6 years.

Normal starter batteries like these don't like deep discharges - it takes only about 3 or 4 full discharges to completely ruin a Lead Acid starter battery. So every time it gets deeply discharged you're shaving a good chunk off it's remaining useful lifetime.

If the 12v battery proves to be sick even after recharging and needs replacement the following is a good article that has all the necessary details:

Go Green Autos - Used EV Specialists - Mitsubishi i-MiEV 12v auxiliary battery

I ended up fitting a Yuasa YBX5054 which is slightly higher capacity (40Ah) than the original but an exact physical dimensional match which will drop right in.

There is some speculation in the myimiev forum that a knackered 12v battery may be the root cause of many of the on-board charger failures that seem to have cropped up lately, presumably due to the 12v batteries of older cars all getting to a certain age where they are starting to fail.

Click to expand...

You'd have to read that big long thread on myimev.com about on-board charger repairs. The common thread among nearly all the failures though is that the 12v battery was found to be on deaths door after the fact.

Not just flat, but almost no usable capacity left after recharging - just like mine was. The car needs so little from the 12v battery compared to an ICE that the battery can get comically weak without the driver noticing any symptoms, other than lack of oomph running accessories when the car is not in READY mode. (Which was my first hint) If you don't ever sit in ACC mode with the radio, heated seats or blower fan on for any significant period of time you'd never notice a problem until it was too late, and that is what's worrying.

If you're lucky the car lets you down and fails to start resulting in needing a tow or a ""jump start"" and everything is OK again after a new 12v battery is fitted, if you're very unlucky maybe it triggers an onboard charger failure.

There are a few theories on how a weak 12v battery could cause damage to the high voltage system, mine is that it could interfere with the contactor sequencing that occurs every time you turn the car on to READY or plug it in to charge.

There isn't just one big contactor (relay) involved, there are several, the ""creaking"" that you hear when you turn the key to start is actually multiple contactors clicking in and out in a specific choreographed sequence.

This includes a pre-charge contactor whose job is to switch in a resistor to charge up the 360v system every time the traction battery is connected (READY, or charging) to avoid the sudden surge that would otherwise occur. This resistor is actually located in the battery enclosure and there have been a couple of examples of this burning out - most likely due to the contactor that is supposed to bypass it after the initial charge failing to make contact as the resistor could only maintain that power level for less than a second.

This could be a result of the battery voltage sagging too much as each additional contactor is powered to the point where the last contactor can't engage even though the ECU thinks it has powered it on.

Capacitors blowing in the on board charger which seems to be one of the common problems are theorised to be the result of an inductive kickback caused by one of the contactors disengaging under load - which they should never do. Normally the ECU would ensure that there was no load (current draw) through the contactors before disconnecting them, by telling all loads like the heater/AC/motor controller to shut down before the contactors open.

Failing to do so could damage either the contactor itself (arcing) or nearby circuitry that isn't designed to cope with a sudden disconnect under load. This again might be a result of a weak 12v battery.

There doesn't seem to be one specific failure mode and there are at least 3 different ways in which they're failing but if there is even a chance that the 12v battery is implicated in them and a new charger is around ¬£1400 if you can't repair it, a ¬£55 battery starts looking like good insurance.

Even if it didn't blow the charger it could still easily let you down on a cold dark road one winter where you can't start the car. Normal 12v car batteries only have an expected lifespan of 3-5 years, so any 2014 or earlier car really ought to have had it replaced by now.

With hindsight Mitsubishi perhaps should have put 12v battery replacement in the 5 year service schedule instead of just letting it go until it fails.",5,2526764

Get that battery replaced ASAP.

There is some speculation in the myimiev forum that a knackered 12v battery may be the root cause of many of the on-board charger failures that seem to have cropped up lately, presumably due to the 12v batteries of older cars all getting to a certain age where they are starting to fail. I'm glad I replaced mine!

I can recommend the Yuasa YBX5054 - it fits perfectly and is performing like a champ, and it's not too expensive at about ¬£55. It's a slightly higher capacity than the original (40Ah instead of 36Ah) and has a 5 year warranty.

You can literally change it yourself with one spanner for the battery post nuts in about 10 minutes.

Click to expand...

My first c-zero (2012, 20k miles) did about 70-75 miles to a charge with my slower style of driving (60mph motorway for more range). My second one, the i-miev does about 85 withthe same style of driving (2012, 7500miles). After mid 2012 citroen/peugot went from 88 cells down to 80 cells, so 16kWh to 14.5 kWh, but claimed the new cells they are using we more efficient so it wouldn't effect the range. From my personal experience I dont buy it and i think the i-miev has a better pack.

I think the low mileage is mainly due to people buying them as city cars which will only really do low miles anyway as thats the sort of people that bought them new. People doing lots of miles wouldnt risk buying a car new that only does 80 miles per charge, especially how niche EVs were in 2012.

I wouldnt worry about the lots of owners, i think that is mainly down to people buying the i-miev and its clones as they are the cheapest EVs around with the intention of using them as a test car before investing more. Thats what I did, I drove the c-zero for 9 months, 9000 miles, before selling it and buying an i3. Sold the i3 to buy a house now back in an i-miev.

Click to expand...

Unless its somehow 2018 already its actually a 6 year old car, same as mine. 

Battery condition is probably good - new capacity is supposedly 46Ah for these which is 16.5kWh, although I haven't seen any with more than 42Ah reported even as low as 5k miles.

Mine has done 34k and is sitting on 39.5Ah or 14.2kWh, The realistic mileage per charge I get depends a lot on driving speeds (and of course heater use) but with no heater on mixed urban/motorway driving I get a realistic 62-65 miles.



That ¬£5k C-Zero looks a good buy initially but it only has a part service history. Is it just me or is that it has had 4 owners over such a low 28,000 mileage a little bit concerning?

Hard to speculate but I'd say that it wasn't quite the car they were looking for. The range is short and it is a small car. Maybe they found either the range or the accommodation inside lacking for their needs.

It's definitely a car with specific uses and not a general purpose car due to both the limited range and the small interior space. However if those are OK for you its a nice little car which is fun to drive and very cheap to run.



What is considered to the best car out of the I-Miev, Ion and C-Zero?

Click to expand...

Absolutely zero difference between the C-Zero and the Ion apart from the badge and the colour of the seats and dashboard - which are grey in the Ion and brown in the C-Zero... and the fact that there are twice as many Ion's in the UK as C-Zero's.

The i-Miev differs a bit more - the front and rear bumpers are a bit different, as is the radio - the Ion/C-Zero has a decent but basic Bluetooth radio while some i-Mievs have a touch screen satnav/radio in its place.

From mid (?) 2012 all three cars got newer LEV50N cells which apparently nearly double the cycle life of the battery, however when this change happened the C-Zero/Ion dropped from 88 cells to only 80 while the i-Miev got 88 of the new type of cells.

PSA claim that they made other changes to the car to maintain the same range with the lesser battery capacity but I'm sceptical. So a 2012 onwards C-Zero/Ion has a battery that will probably last twice as long as it ages but will do a bit less per charge than mine when it was new.

Yet another difference is that 2012 and later i-Miev's had the option of remote pre-heat using an RF remote control on your key ring. Not sure if this was an option or they all had it. The Ion/C-Zero have no pre-heat at all regardless of year.

So on paper a 2012 or later i-Miev has considerably better specs - longer cycle life battery but still with the full 16kWh capacity, touch screen GPS, remote pre-heat. But prior to 2012 there isn't much to set the i-Miev apart apart from the radio/GPS.

There was also a very rare special edition i-Miev that had leather seats and stitched leather dashboard, compared to the standard very hard foam and cloth seats and hard plastic dashboard...",1,0

Thanks for the tip. Gave them a call and spoke to Donny. He said he hasn't had or seen any for ages, said was almost always ex council in the past like you say. He has my info and said he will give me a shout if he gets anything.

I had the chance again to buy the Citroen C-Zero Electric E 5dr (48kw) listed at ¬£5000 but the seller would sell for ¬£4500. Their previous enquiry/potential sale came to nothing and it is available still if anyone is interested.

I was seriously tempted to go for it, the long train trip down was a minor hassle. The drive home would have been a crappy and epic one with a million charging stops, but that didn't put me off. Think it was the age/price. Having pondered over this car for a while, I think with the bigger but older battery ¬£4500 is maybe a little pricey, and ¬£4000 might have been a better price. All subjective of course!

When I looked at 1-day insurance on these cars to drive them home, was coming in at ¬£30-¬£35, what a rip-off. Would be better just taking out a traditional 12 month policy, then if anything goes wrong with the sale, you always have 14 days to cancel an insurance policy.

So are you having any luck? Because I am not. Have sourced options for all the 3 car types, but only 1 with a reasonable price (but still to expensive).

Some of the pricing is simply ridiculous.

Peugeot Ion **64Hp**Full Electric**No ROAD TAX**Service History**

I queried with the used dealer if they could budge on the ¬£6250 price. I explained it was always concerning when these cars had been sitting idle for so long and it was not good for the battery and heightened degradation was inevitable. It has done 13,000 miles in over 6 years now. About 2000 miles a year average.

The dealer told me ""the car has been used daily and inspected every 3 months"".

1. Hard to believe and, 2. What does inspected every 3 months even mean!

I think ¬£5000 max, and probably closer to ¬£4000 would be a more realistic price. Dealers seem to just sit on these cars forever.

The price isn't too much above what they're going for with low mileage, but the comment about a new traction battery having been fitted is worrying. More likely is that it's had a new 12v battery.

Click to expand...

What do you mean by ""lost cells"" ? If you mean individual faulty cells then that seems to be exceedingly rare on these. I've seen two documented cases of an individual faulty cell on these that was replaced.

Of course gradual degradation of all cells is a potential issue like any EV. I didn't run a diagnostic on mine until after I bought it, (silly taking a chance, I know, but it's not always easy to plug a laptop in and run diagnostics on a car that you're looking to buy on the day) but since then I've checked it 

All the cells in my 2011 Ion are perfectly balanced (so no individual bad cells) and at the time I bought it in March at 28k miles the SOH measured by a diagnostic tool was 86.7%, and in July at 33k I checked it again and it had dropped to 85.9%.

When you compare that to the SOH of a 2011 Leaf at similar mileages it compares very favourably I think...



And 2013 and beyond models also will be prone to cell loss although not quite as standard.

Click to expand...

The later LEV50N cells are supposed to have at least twice the cycle life of the earlier LEV50 cells in mine, and have better performance at high charge/output rates as well, so I would imagine they will last very well.

Click to expand...

Yes, but it's not very accurate for two reasons:

1) You can't tell if its 100% charged unless you just saw it finish charging. You can get quite a few miles before it drops one bar - I can manage about 8 miles without losing a bar, whereas below that its approximately 4 miles per bar.

2) The GOM estimate depends heavily on the energy consumption in the previous 15 miles of driving. So if it was driven slowly and carefully you'll get a much higher range remaining on a full charge. If I stick to 30mph and below I can easily get an estimate of 75 or more (I've seen over 80) even though I've never achieved this. On a motorway you might only get a full charge estimate of 57-60 miles.

If there is an individual cell that is faulty or below the capacity of the other cells, the usable capacity of the pack as a whole will be limited to the capacity of the worst cell in the pack.

16 bars and 64 miles is about 4 miles per bar. But as above its still very approximate.

The only way to know for sure is to get the usable Ah capacity using a diagnostic tool - using either Canion or Evbatmon (android apps using a bluetooth OBD-II dongle) or Diagbox/Lexia which is the dealer diagnostic tool. (which I have a clone of)

100% SOH is 46Ah. (They're 50Ah cells but they are only charged to 4.1v to increase the cycle life so only about 90% of the raw rated capacity is usable even when new)",1,1233641

It's the car that tells the charger to stop at 81% on a rapid charge however you can restart the charge and charge to at least 90% if you want.

That extra 10% only gives you about 6 miles and takes a long time though, (about 20-25 minutes) so normally isn't worth doing (especially if another car is waiting on the charger) unless you know you're about to make a leg of the journey that you'll be cutting really fine if you don't.

Hi Eddie,

Its got an MK Toughplug on it and a pretty new robust external socket - I took the opportunity on wednesday morning as it was quite cold to plug it in, after a couple of hours it was getting very warm. I would suspect even the fuse would give out some warmth at 12A, on a hot day it would definitely be dangerous. I'm not sure how much better a plated plug would fare. I have ordered 16A commando plug and socket and a waterproof switch - was about ¬£13 all in, that will be enable me to charge the car safely for the time being while I get an MOT and see if everything else works.

In the meantime i'll try and hunt down a newer charger/make a good one out of broken ones/modify the one I have.

You would probably have more success with an aftermarket charger. I think it's really a matter of having a realistic view of you usage patterns. If you regularly visit a particular relative, install another 16A CEE socket there as well as at your home.

Yeah, I agree modifying the dumb charger is going to be difficult. Probably best to hunt hard for a newer charger or fix a broken newer one. I am hoping the US warranty extension on charge units will come to the UK one day !

Haha I can see the conversation now ""Would you like to come round for a BBQ on Saturday?"" me: ""Yes please, I'll bring my tools, i've got a present for your garage..."". To be honest I could probably convince my dad on the basis it would be easier to plug his caravan in ;-)

If anyone vaguely near SE England has a broken charger i'd be very interested in it !!

Hi this is all correct however this is more complex than just being an early car. I didnt want to make the opening post overly difficult to follow but in this case the car originally did have an EVSE-compatible charger but this failed (and not in any repairable way - there is a hole burned through the PCB!) and as a replacement an early ""dumb"" charger was put in, so if i can get the right bits it will work on this car.

Of course you are right, if you get an early car and just put a later charger in, it will not work with an EVSE charger for various reasons such as the cable from the charge port probably not even having the pilot wire.

Apologies for any confusion, just wanted to keep it not too complicated to follow, and I appreciate your advice.

It's not ""adaptive"" cruise control. It is a basic cruise control but you can set it to the speed limit shown on the traffic sign display. If you engage cruise control, you can double tap the MEM button and it will default to the displayed speed limit. Many journalists fell for that one.

The ONLY way, at the moment you can get a SOC display is if you are plugged into a charger and you open the drivers door and it will give you an SOC and show you the charging rate. The only other way is to use the My.Vauxhall app and if you're in a loan car, you won't be connected to that unless you buy a new one.

Before about mid 2012 the Mitsubishi and PSA models (C-Zero/Ion) are much the same, the radio is different and there are small differences in the exterior styling, key fob etc but that is all.

After 2012 there are significant divergences. All 3 cars got newer longer lasting (less degradation with age) LEV50N cells after 2012 but in the PSA cars the number of cells was reduced from 88 to 80 cells - reducing battery capacity from 16kWh to about 14.5kWh. The newier i-Miev's got 88 of the new longer lasting cells.

Preheating was also an option on later i-Miev's using a weird key remote thing, this was never available on the PSA versions. Early i-Miev and all PSA versions cannot run the heater while plugged in to charge, which means no pre-heating from AC power.

I believe the Tamashii pack was an improved interior - stitched leather seats and dashboard, which I would love to have as the standard seats are rather hard and uncomfortable foam! Not sure what else the pack might have had. I think there are only about a dozen cars in the UK with this pack so chances of finding one are slim!

Ion's seem to be the most common in the UK. If you check howmanyleft.co.uk you'll see there are about twice as many Ion's on the road as there are C-Zero's or i-Mievs. This is probably due to Peugeot mainly leasing them while Mitsubishi and Citroen were mainly selling them, because brand new they were a very expensive car in relation to their true (IMHO) value.",0,None

Grade 1: The vehicle may have minor interior and exterior defects that require SMART repairs, i.e. minor scratches or dents and minor replacement parts could also be required. 

Grade 2: The vehicle may require repairs as per Grade 1 plus up to 1 major or minor bodyshop repair. The replacement of more significant internal or external trim parts (excluding panels) may also be required. 

Grade 3: The vehicle may require repairs as per Grade 1 & 2 plus may include up to 5 minor bodyshop repairs, 3 major bodyshop repairs or a combination of major and minor repairs. The vehicle may include a single replacement bumper. 

Grade 4: The vehicle may require repairs as per Grade 1, 2 & 3. It may have a combination of major and minor repairs and could include a non-structural replacement panel. 

Grade 5: The vehicle may require repairs as per Grade 1, 2, 3 & 4. It may have a combination of major and minor repairs, or the vehicle may have sustained collision damage and the replacement of up to two structural panels may be required (providing there is no other damage on the vehicle). 

Unclassified: Vehicles in this grade are simply uneconomical to appraise and fall into one of the following categories. 
‚Ä¢ Substantial Accident Damage 
‚Ä¢ Major Parts Missing

Lease companies aren't interested in leasing vehicles over a certain age, statistically they will begin to have more failures requiring repair, further servicing, won't be in as good condition, etc. They provide nice shiny new vehicles for a number of years and charge accordingly.

From the point of view of the people who had the vehicles, they are paying monthly (probably getting some kind of grant for having electric vehicles) and for the same monthly cost can get new vehicles when they get to x years old.",0,2682802

When buying a used C-Zero or iOn, go for the 14,5 kWh battery, the new cells are superior to the old ones used in the previous 16 kWh battery. Moreover, since the battery efficiency improved a lot (see the Ragone curve in the PDF documents) you‚Äôll be able to get the same range.
However, only in 2015 the Citroen C-Zero and the Peugeot iOn got the battery warranty increased from 5 years and 50.000 km to 8 years and 100.000 km. Therefore you might want to avoid buying an used unit that was registered before 2015.",0,None

Click to expand...

You might be surprised. I hadn't been to an auction for a long time, and went to one last year to see if anything had changed. For a couple of cars that I followed, the total price for private buyers was approaching what I would offer a dealer. Many were being won over the internet for what I thought were high prices. The online bidding is not something that existed when I previously bought an auction car. 

The cars can be bought online for those with an account, so don't assume they'll sell cheaply if nobody in the room is buying them. They may also have a reserve. Determine what they would sell for retail, then work back deducting the buyers premium etc etc. That would be my max bid price. The dealers will hopefully be much lower as they will want a minimum margin (I'd guess ¬£2k?), although they may bid it up if they notice a newbie is desperate for a car. Or there may be a dealer who'll scoop up all the cars if they know they can easily sell them on. 

It's worth going to an auction for an interesting day out. I'd observe for a few visits before bidding. Most of the places have a cafe and you can wander around looking at the cars and follow them into the hall. The only time you will know the selling price is when the hammer falls. If you miss it you won't know what a car sold for. So to get a feel for selling prices I would create a spreadsheet with a range of cars I was interested in and capture some data. That's what I did years ago. Now my time is worth more than going through that hassle. Also, I'd be much more wary buying EV from an auction as we know there can be lots of expensive things to go wrong.",2,2682770

A lot of work doing it that way so I would recommend using a proper car lift if you have access to one, and it could be done in a fraction of the time.

I think I posted photos and description on here somewhere but can't find it now! (It would have been around 2019)

Lift or not, I would only tackle the job yourself if you have decent electronics / electrical safety knowledge and decent mechanical skills as well. Otherwise get someone who does to help you. (You don't want to be crushed or electrocuted, or end up with a half done job you can't put back together...)

It is a fair bit of work to get the battery out and back in again. Very rough steps to give you an idea of what you're in for if you tackle it:

Disconnect 12v battery.
Remove front left seat and lift the left hand side carpet up so you can disconnect the air vent to the battery that goes under the carpet.
Remove high voltage fuse from under the hatch under the front left seat.
Remove plastic covers off the bottom of the traction battery.
Disconnect the two orange HV cables at the front going to the A/C compressor and PTC heater. (Careful, the locking tabs are really brittle...)
Remove access panels from the bottom of the traction battery so you can disconnect the orange HV cables going into both sides - one goes to the drive inverter, the other to the Chademo socket.
Disconnect the low voltage power/data lines from the left hand side of the traction battery.
Support the battery pack in the middle with a trolley of some kind (the battery weighs approx 150Kg) and start removing all the large mounting bolts around the perimeter. Roughly 10 of these from memory.
Remove the small bolts near the rear corners of the battery which bolt some small plates from the chassis to the battery pack.
I think there are a couple of separate earth wires to disconnect as well.
Once all the bolts are out raise the car a few inches until you can get your hand over the top of the rear of the battery pack - there is a plug to disconnect the extraction fan that can't be reached until they are separated a bit but if you go too far you'll tug on the cable and damage it.

Refitting is mostly the same in reverse, however pay special attention to the air vent grommet below the front left seat - it will not go into the right place by itself, you need to bring the battery up (or the car down) until it is starting to engage then manually engage the rubber grommet and make sure it is sitting right by the time the battery is in place. If you just move the battery into place you'll crush the grommet and it won't seal.
Once the battery is fully in place you can refit the vent pipes from the air vent across to the heater box which run under the carpet.

That's all just from memory 3 years ago so I might have missed something!

As its a lot of work to do this just to replace brake pipes I would take the opportunity to do rust repair/treatment while the battery is out. Mine was pretty yucky up above the battery due to water running down from the drains through some of the bolt holes. These cars are not well rust protected and rust very easily. ",0,None

One caveat to that though - I have heard that if the 12v battery is disconnected for more than about a month the BMS (Battery Monitoring System) might lose the Ah (SoH) calibration data for the traction battery. This would require a diagnostic tool like Diagbox (standard Peugeot/Citroen diagnostic tool) to correct by running a capacity calibration. I had mine all disconnected for about a week possibly more and didn't experience any problem however.

The US version of the i-Miev is physically wider and differs in some ways to the Japanese / European version so while I'm sure it's similar it may have differences regarding physical mounting of the traction battery.

Pretty sure I've seen the data you need online - you might just have to look a bit harder!

Our tech put Buz up on his (full size) 2 post lifter and we looked underneath. The rear pack cover came off quite easily, and sure enough, the pipes to the rear brakes were showing significant signs of rusting on both sides. Luckily, we could follow their route a little further forwards towards the left and right hand side of the battery pack, before they rose up and over the pack and out of sight. Just before disappearing, however, they each passed through a small accessible cavity where they showed little or no corrosion, and he suggested that they could replace just the rusty parts with new pipes (with the joins in the respective cavities), promising that he would first ‚Äúdo whatever was necessary‚Äù to inspect the condition of the pipes as they continued their route over the battery pack and towards the front.

He called a few hours later that day and told me the work was done. They‚Äôd taken off the rear wheel arch trims on both sides (and possibly others too), and, looking forward from the cavities could just about see that the pipes were in perfectly serviceable condition, being by then (ironically) well protected by the battery pack. He did say it had been a bit of a struggle to make the joins themselves since space and access were so limited, but that he was perfectly happy to pass the car as being roadworthy (he‚Äôs a registered MOT tester too). They‚Äôd also covered the new ‚Äúcopper pipes‚Äù in grease (I‚Äôm assuming he meant copper-nickel since pure copper pipes have long since fallen out of favour), but from what I can see on-line, copper-nickel in it‚Äôs various alloys is already very resilient to corrosion, much better than steel alone.

So, at the end of the day, it‚Äôs cost me just ¬£100 plus the cost of a new MOT as the 10 days for a simple retest had run out by then. OK, so I don‚Äôt get to waxoyl the chassis above the pack, but I‚Äôm happy to take it a year at a time for now. It‚Äôs such a brilliant car for short (in my case up to 50-ish mile round trips) and such a shame Mitsubishi didn‚Äôt pre-treat the chassis during manufacture, but we are where we are and I accept Buz won‚Äôt last forever.

Regarding copper/nickel pipes - they're more resistant to corrosion than untreated steel pipes for sure, but they can still corrode a little left bare, in a similar way to plain copper where they can go green.

I replaced a hydraulic pipe on my (now 25 year) old ICE car several years ago - which was originally painted steel that had corroded through - with a custom made copper/nickel pipe, as the original pipes haven't been available for years now and I notice that it is a little bit corroded looking now, mainly copper like green scale, but not physically weakened in any way.

I've also got an e2008, I live in Cardiff, and last weekend took a trip west to Tenby - 90 miles each way. 
General point, if you can avoid taking the roof box by packing the car better, do that. The roof box will substantially increase aerodynamic drag and I would expect it to hit your range. 
I have been to London area several times from Cardiff, cruising at 70 or whatever the limit is if lower, usually the car needs charging just before the M25, ie 120 miles. 

Before you set off, download the apps you might need - I have Electric Highway, GeniePoint, Pod Point, BP Pulse.

I generally filter on Zap Map to show where 50Kw or faster CCS chargers are. 

On the English bit of the M4, I recently used one just off J15, BP Pulse. They have two that are super-rapid 150kw chargers at a BP fuel station, but when I arrived, one was broken, one in use, so I used the 50kw charger at the Holiday Inn, 100m behind.

West of Cardiff, there's: 
J36 Sarn Park - 50kw Ecotricity/Electric Highway - used it last weekend, pleasant Starbucks

J47 Swansea W services - 50kw Ecotricity/Electric Highway - tried to use it last weekend but was busy
I also used a 50kw rapid in Tenby (not on your route), which is Dragon Charging/GeniePoint. 

If you search for chargers in south/west Wales, you will find a good number of both rapids and destination chargers listed under Dragon Charging Dragon Charging Network ‚Äì EV Charging in Wales.

I live near Alton and regularly had to drive to Newport for meetings. It is a little over 2 hours. Brighton is an hour the other way, cross country. As in plan A above, a 15 minute stop in Bracknell should add 10 kWh to your battery or 30 miles. If t he children need a comfort break you have Reading or Membury services which if the Ecotricity chargers are working and avaliable could give you more miles. If I remember rightly one of the chargers on the dock route round Newport is in a pub car park close to some Golden Arches! Vegan opportunities are less likely but you can pack your own, I would! And once back on the M4 it should be fairly quick, though I confess never done the trip on a Bank Holiday. I have done Haverfordwest to Alton leaving at 18:30 and arriving back at 10:30 one Sunday evening. I doubt you will need to add more than an hour or so for charging.

My wife picked it up on Friday evening, and Saturday morning we set off. It was back at the tail end of 2014, from Dorset to Anglesey. I always have a chuckle to myself if anyone tells me the rapid charger network isn‚Äôt any good these days! You should have seen what it was like then. We knew what we were getting into though, so no need to feel sorry for us!
My point is, there are really loads of options now, and it sounds like you are prepared and know what you're looking for with the advice above about ABRP, ZapMap and PlugShare type maps to find your way. Take it easy. Enjoy your holiday!

What's in the car will make very little difference to range. But the roofbox will knock approx 10% off your range if you keep the speeds to 65mph or less. Keep that in mind as Zapmap won't factor that in. Might be worth accepting it'll take longer to take a more rural route than motorway but it'll be more relaxing as you'll keep the speed down and the range won't tank so much.

Have a think about how you are going to charge your car when you are there, Wales isn't know for a lot of chargers. If you can't charge at your destination for your return trip then I would suggest finding a rapid charger near your destination on the way there and topping up when the cars battery is warm. Setting off with a low state of charge and using a rapid charger straight away isn't good as the cold battery will reduce the charging current to protect itself.

Yep it's off road. We actually made a very bold move and installed a home charger on the post of the steps up to our terraced house (no off road parking). It's worked really well so far. And so the one thing we have EV experience in is how to minimise trip risk for pedestrians on pavements...

Thank you. You don't need to be low on charge for this, you're not trying to find your fastest charge speed, just need to put in a couple of kilowatts to make sure it works. I did the same with the MG just before our holidays last year and we've been driving electric for 3 cars and 5 years.

Name: Unnamed: 0, dtype: int64",8250,"May 26, 2021","Hi there - lots of good advice already but here is my 2p worth, we've done Southampton to West Wales a couple of times - wasn't so far (235 miles c/w your 300 miles or so) but our Leaf had a battery less than half the size of yours, so it was a bit of a mission! (2 children, but no dogs or a roof box)

Looks like the e208 battery is 50kWh with 45kWh usable, without the roof box I'd expect to get about 180 miles from it (100% to 0%) at this time of year if taking it pretty easy (60 ish) on the Mway (4 miles/kWh) but with the roofbox I'm guessing 140-150 miles (about 3-3.5 miles/kWh).

1st stop for me would thus be the BP Pulse charger mentioned by @chris-b near Swindon (SN3 6AA - circa 118 miles). He mentions another charger nearby, and there is also an Instavolt not too far away (SN1 2EQ) but hopefully you'd not need that.

2nd stop would be the McDonald's Port Talbot (SA12 6LL, 105 miles from the 1st stop) - never been, but it's nicely en-route and has Instavolt - possibly not my ideal venue but my children would certainly enjoy it ;-). You've then only got about 80 miles to go.

For the way back (assuming heading straight back, with a full tank) I'd go for the Instavolt at Bannatyne's Health Club at Newport (118 miles, NP20 2AQ). Note that the postcode on Zap Map is wrong which caught us out, I did tell them but they haven't changed it. We had a nice smoothie there whilst charging a couple of years ago!

2nd stop would be the 104 miles to Instavolt at Winnersh Business Park (RG41 5TS)

If you haven't got one I'd quickly apply for a BP Pulse RFID card (3 months free membership then about ¬£8/month but you can cancel any time) as you may wish to use it on this trip (bp pulse) - else you'd need to get setup with the app (still doesn't look like they do contactless). They have a few chargers just off the M4 which could be handy for you, unfortunately mostly just the 1 device per site.

I'd also get a Shell Recharge RFID card (free) as this will let you access more networks without needing the apps - I'm thinking of Ionity in particular but you might find it handy sometime). NB There is a great Ionity hub off the M4 near Chippenham, expensive but also has a nice shop!

In general I'd avoid Ecotricity for now, which is a nuisance as they're at the Motorway Service Areas (MSAs) - thankfully all their chargers are due to be replaced by Gridserve (should be this year), which will hopefully make life much easier for occasions like this.

Instavolt and Osprey are the two networks I prefer, as they both have contactless and have been 100% reliable for me. Most of their sites have more than one charger which increases the chances of avoiding a queue and of one working (tho' I've not seen a dead one of theirs yet).

Good Luck!

Edit: A bit geeky but this is the charge curve for the e208:

If you drive a Peugeot e-208 then you use the CCS connector. It could be that there is a plastic cover, covering the bottom part of the charge port. If so, this plastic cover needs to be removed in...

You'll notice the amount of energy provided by the charger drops off as the battery fills up - if undertaking the stops I suggested I'd want it charged to 90% after the 1st stops but would finish a little earlier at the 2nd stops (say 80%).

Sadly the socket got too warm, so ended up buying a replacement locally, plus new electrical screwdriver to take it all apart. So I now try to charge at 6A only, maybe 8A, and am avoiding use of 10A altogether.
Here's a pic of the socket I swapped out:









Heat generation goes up as the square of the current being passed, so 8A generates 77% more heat than 6A does, and 10A generates 177% more than 6A does! So you can see that 10A continuous is asking a lot more from the socket. 6A is being very kind & gentle & should give no problems.

If they had the right equipment, but there's no reason to expect a Renault dealer to have the right equipment. I'm assuming the Ion was a trade in that they got from someone buying a Zoe...

To be honest I wouldn't trust the GOM range remaining figure on a one off test drive anyway because it can vary so dramatically based on driving style.

For example if it has been flogged hard along a motorway before you saw the car it will be very pessimistic, but if it has only been driven gently at 30mph on a few test drives before you saw the car it will be very optimistic! The range remaining is based both on the amount of charge left in the battery and how it has been driven for the last 15 miles.

I drove the same car twice before buying it with a week in between each test drive, and the GOM full charge range was more than 10 miles less the second time I saw the car - purely due to the way it had been driven in between.",0,2368362

Car salesmen are clueless about SoH of batteries, even of their own brand of car let alone someone else's! SoH of the battery has almost no bearing on the second hand price at the moment, and isn't even a consideration for those selling.

The dealer who sold me my Ion - nice, genuine guy, had sold more than a dozen ex council Ion's but didn't know anything about the SoH of a battery or how to measure it.

It was clear that I knew more about the car than he did after reading SpeakEV for a few months and doing a little bit of research.

It's not helped by the fact that on many cars such as an Ion, it can only be found with a suitable diagnostic tool, rather than through the dashboard of the car. I think eventually battery SoH will be legally required to be visible on the dashboard and tamper proof in the same way that an odometer is today, since it could affect the sale value of the car.

Today your choices buying a 2nd hand EV and worrying about battery SoH are:

1) Take the dealers word for it. (Not advisable when they don't have a clue, so are just as likely to mislead you through ignorance as malice)

2) Try to estimate the SoH from the GOM and current state of charge. You'd need to be familiar with what mileage you'd expect of a full charge for the car and hope that it has been driven ""reasonably"" recently, or have a long enough test drive to gauge it yourself, but keeping in mind that this method is still open to a lot of error and will only catch out the really bad batteries.

3) Be prepared ahead of time and take a small diagnostic tool with you that you can plug in and get an actual Ah reading. That does mean an upfront cost in buying an adaptor/software/android device if you don't have all these already, but they might be a good investment if the same hardware will work with other EV's.

For example the adaptor and Android tablet I use with Canion will also happily run Leaf spy, CanZe etc, so I have everything I need to do a SoH check on many other EV's if I'm ever changing in the future or just to help out a fellow EV driver - if there is an Android app available to check the battery on a car, I can do it.

Two problems I see with this approach:

a) A dealer might not be keen on letting you plug a diagnostic tool into their car in case you cause a problem...

b) The SoH/Ah figure is only really useful to you to make a buy / no buy decision. If you're not happy with the battery health at the price offered, you can choose to walk away.

Unfortunately at this point in time on the EV adoption curve I don't think a lower than expected Ah/SoH can be used as a bargaining tool to get the price knocked down, both because dealers have no clue about SoH in the first place, and also because what reason would they have to believe a diagnostic tool that you have brought and used yourself ? For all they know you might be scamming them. (Oh the irony. )

So I think the realistic options are - try to gauge the battery health from the GOM combined with SoC and cross your fingers, (which is what I ended up doing) or plug in your own diagnostic tool to make a decision whether to buy or walk away.",0,None

I had a play with OBDZero tonight and while it looks promising I'm afraid I can't recommend it for measuring the Ah capacity of the battery, as it doesn't give results that agree with other methods of measurement, or even a consistent result.

Diagbox, Canion and even Hobdrive all agree that my battery health is currently 36.7Ah, however OBDZero gives different results.

Unfortunately the ""default"" placeholder figure before connecting to the car of 37.5Ah is quite close to my actual battery capacity, confusing the issue a bit.

There are Ah figures on both the OBD screen and the Calc screen. I don't know what the Cap. Ah figures (drive and charge) on the Calc screen are measuring, but they sure aren't measuring the same thing as the other apps!

They default to 37.5 but once connected to the car the figure starts at 35.8 and slowly counts up to 37.9 and then drops to 35.8 again repeating the cycle. I literally have no clue what these figures are trying to represent or why there would be a different figure for drive or charge, and there is no documentation to explain it.

The true Ah figure reported by the BMS only changes about once a month at most, so this figure should not be varying at all from moment to moment.

The Cap. Ah figure beside the battery voltage on the OBD screen looks like it may be the right place to measure the Ah capacity, however it just sits on the default 37.5Ah figure never changing to the correct value, despite other PID data like battery voltage updating OK.

Shame, as the app has potential, but at this time it can't be used for Ah measurements.",0,2368488

Not possible on a quick test drive unfortunately.

You'd need to charge the car to 100% and let it finish balancing first, (which would take hours depending on where it started) and then drive it on the motorway for about 45 minutes to get the battery low enough.

It is charged to full every night and the GOM (guess O meter) says 67miles in the summer going down to 60 in the winter. Using the heater knocks 10 miles off that range. The battery is Lithium Titanate I believe one of the best at coping with repeated charging. Check out Jeff Dahn on YouTube. 
We took it to Fullycharged live from Bournemouth 120 miles and three charges It will only charge to 80% on the CHadeMo but from 10% it only takes 20mins. Long journeys need planning but can be done if you are patient.

Cheers, Blurb. 
Charging is an interesting question for us. As we have our own solar panels installed with accompanying battery bank (that is composed of ~4,5 of LEAF batteries) that power our own fast and slow chargers, we won't be adding a lot of power (say 150kW) to it anytime soon anyway. And using the public chargers for ultra-fast charging isn't good money-wise. So for us, 50kW DC is effectively enough when talking about fast charging. 
What we'd love, however, is to have as big of an onboard-charger as possible. Really sad that no one else has done it well except Zoe (which isn't fit for taxi). Because with 11-22kW onboard charger, we could power our fleet fully without any use of the DC 50kW+ chargers, as we could arrange our shifts that way. The key there is also of how efficient the car is of course. But overall it's a tremendous cost difference for our base, if we buy 50kW DC chargers or we buy AC chargers that handle 11-22kW each. We're talking about around 15-20k‚Ç¨ per DC charger and ~2k‚Ç¨ for the other... 

Our average shift is around 200km, so the 22kW charger could provide a shift's work with around 2hrs (if not taken into account any losses etc and ~20kWh/100km, which LEAF more or less has). We can easily factor this in with our cars, having them charged between shifts and maybe pump it up while in a carwash from DC also.",1,2922822

Sure, wouldn't want to just drive people to elsewhere - this here is a place to discuss. 

We did compare efficiency, as it really is a great metric - efficiency IS king. Didn't want to include it in the post as it's very subjective to conditions, driver, etc. If we round it out a bit, then on similar driving style on similar conditions, we got around 17.5kWh/100km for ID.3 and ~19.5kWh/100km for LEAF. Note, that it had some driving with 100+km/h as well. Looked like ID.3 is definitely about 10-20% more efficient, will have to conduct more test to be sure (never trust what the car's own computer tells ya).

What I did note, is that LEAF seems to start losing a lot more on efficiency on the high speeds (110-130km/h or 68-80mph) comparing to ID.3. I only had the chance to test it on ~30km stretch, but that's what I saw.",1,2922882

Plus, Type-2 is universal for all platforms, right now we run on ChaDemo for fast charging but that will render itself out in the near future in Europe (even Nissan is using CCS on their Aryia).

But I will still look into it as there might be smth useful - thanks for the idea. ",0,2923322

Does the rear wheel drive give you smaller turning circle, quite important for city taxis.

Not by much, Ken. It seems that LEAFs turning circle is 10.6m; ID.3's is 10.2m. 

The most fun experience on a turning circle has been for me with the Honda E. It shows 9.2m, but it sure feels like 4m... REALLY fun. ",0,2923032

Thanks, Lilies. Sadly I think we won't be able to compare the MG's anytime soon, as we haven't heard them entering the Estonian market at all  
Would love to check them out, seem like great cars so far.",0,2924371
