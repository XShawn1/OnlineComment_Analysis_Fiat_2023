Drove the Mini e, BMW i3S (we own the regular BMW i3 already) and Peugeot e-208 all in 1 afternoon last summer 2020. Wife was choosing her next car. Was driving an Audi S3 (300bhp+) at the time.

Mini e runs the BMW i3s running gear -181bhp motor (instead of 184bhp in the i3S) but to the front wheels. It is a powerful and fun car to drive but we found the ride too harsh and unsettled overall for our British urban pot holed and bumpy roads but excellent if the tarmac was smooth. As there is so much torque going through the front wheels you get torque steer pretty much all the time on acceleration which the cheeky nature of the car urges you to do all the time! And we test drove on a nice sunny day. Would be worse in the rain.- a big no-no for me. I prefer rear wheel drive (eg-i3) as a result. A pain to get in the back as 3 door only, but once there actually ok for headroom but if you are tall driver rear legroom is going to be an issue. Pretty tiny boot and no frunk as this is based on the ICE Mini platform. Without the sunroof, car will feel claustrophobic and cramped but actually plenty of room for front passengers. Well equipped overall. 
As it is a fun car, the powerful running gear counts against it, as the range will be poor if you drive it in a fun/Mini sort of way. Pretty efficient drivetrain as 7+ years of BMW e-platform experience has gone in to it (much better than the similar battery sized Honda e) but you still have to expect 90-110 miles real world range.

500e has a bigger battery but just felt more modern. Same issues with cramped rear. Not as powerful but more than fast enough and no real torque steer as not as much torque I guess going through the front wheels. 500e rides better also- but close overall.

After driving all 3 last year, wife chose the Peugeot e-208. Liked the looks of it above all else (subjective) but thought the cabin was Audi like in quality and build. Another surprise. After almost 5 months she still absolutely loves it and to be fair I have been very very impressed with it. We both love our sports cars and they should be fun above all else. The e-208 is certainly that. GT model fully loaded with pano sunroof. Seems to better and more fun than the Corsa e which shares it's platform. 

I know you asked about the Mini e but e-208 is proper 5 seater (at a squeeze)- Mini strict 4 seater only and cramped at that. e-208 has a more useful boot. Bigger battery at 50kWh and faster charging speed at up to 100kw (Mini 33kWh battery?-Still only 50kW charge speed). 

500e- 85kW which is fast enough to charge a 40-45kWh battery. 

And the 208 is Europes best selling car, which came as a surprise to us, but not really now we come to think of it. Peugeot 2008, Europes 2nd best selling car to boot! Yes they are both available as petrol, diesel and electric models but they must have done something right to knock the typical Ford Fiesta, Renault Clio or VW Golf off their perches!

If it is between the 500e and Mini I would take the 500e. It is a proper and very modern high quality feeling (la Prima edition sampled only) EV with a decent sized battery and range and good enough charge speeds. If you can live with the smallish boot (very small on the convertible as it has small boot opening also) and cramped rear space. It will be an excellent commuting car as fun also.

Mini e is a converted EV on an ageing platform but then again is tried and tested. BMW/Mini will be releasing a new ground up Mini EV in conjunction with Great Wall Motors of China (I believe) in the coming months.Probably early to mid 2022."
463,0,2022-01-18,"I've posted this before, but it is an illustration as to just how different the true range of all cars, no matter what fuel they use, is from the advertised range. In 2005 I bought a Toyota Prius hybrid, and decided to monitor its performance to see how much more efficient it was when compared to other cars I'd owned.

That car is advertised as having a (extra-urban) range of 668 miles (from the official mpg and the fuel tank capacity). That is a complete joke, the very best I ever managed to get out of it was a range of only 607 miles, and in winter that range dropped massively to only 506 miles.

The thing lost over 160 miles of its advertised range in winter. My wife's Yaris was actually worse, that didn't get as close as the Prius to meeting its advertised range. You will find it's exactly the same for ever other car every sold - the specs never come close to reality.

The issue with EVs is that the range is stated in the WLTP testing, rather than the mpg (which has to be divided into the usable fuel tank capacity to get the range). This means that reviews and advertising for ICE vehicles rarely ever mentions the range. As another example, the first few cars I owned were all Minis. The fuel tank held around 5 gallons and they might manage to get 40mpg if driven carefully. That meant that they had a maximum range of no more than about 200 miles, and in reality the range was a fair bit less than that most of the time."
314,0,2022-05-22,"The Mokka wheels are a big enough pain, there are enough gaps to see how dirty they are inside the wheel but the gaps are too small to easily get in there.
When I bought replacements for the winter tyres I made sure they were a bit more open so cleaning was easier.
In the past I had some similar wheels to the 500e not quite as many spokes but what I found after the first clean which involved ripping up a bed sheet and flossing with it on top of brushing, sponging, buckets and buckets of water and at least 2 different wheel cleaning sprays and even more water was in all honesty just clean them more often.

I have a worx hydroshot and just give the wheels a quick blast once a week.
Depending on the mileage you might need to use one of the colour changing spray on products and a soft paintbrush every other time but at least one in four times its worth getting to the inside edges of the wheels and giving them a good wipe over being careful not to knock the weights about too much.

Or whip a wheel off to do a better job.

168,0,2023-03-10,"Screenwash...
I usually use Preston, the yellow one which I dilute.
It really will look like an old man's dribbles whereas my Mokka looked like a horse taking a leak.
Long story short, I was recommended to use rainX screenwash, now I get smears.
Back to Prestone I guess.
Incidentally I dilute it with water saved from a dehumidifier so it's much better than tap water which I find can cause issues if it's hard water.

Crap at the bottom of the hatch seems to be a thing with modern cars, same problem on my last three cars which is a bit of a pain.

Wiper blades need to be the right size/shape/type for the vehicle but might give, my Mokka had a small spot that was being missed for a period of time but the blade seemed to give a bit with use and all was good. You could buy some better quality blades if the problem persists. Bosch make some decent blades but I'd not worry yet.

672,0,2020-11-19,"When importing a car from the America to the UK, you can do so completely tax free if you have owned the car for at least six months and have lived outside the EU for over 12 months.

If these criteria don’t apply then cars built in the EU are subject to £50 duty and 20% VAT, based on the amount you paid for the car, with those built outside of the EU coming in at 10% duty and 20% VAT.

Most cars that are over 30 years old will qualify for 5% import VAT and no duty when being imported, providing they haven’t been significantly modified from their original use and are not intended to be your daily driver."
713,0,2020-11-23,"While it would be cool to bring across a Fiat 500e, i think the practicalities would make it more hassle than it's worth:

1. As mentioned, insurance might be an issue and could cost a lot.
2. I believe the vehicle will still need to pass an IVA (Individual Vehicle Approval) prior to being registered in the UK - this is more cost and hassle.
3. Once you have it in the UK, if something goes wrong you might be stuck for quite a while to get parts.

Once you add up all the various expenses, I think you would be better to pick up a second hand Nissan Leaf in the UK - it will probably cost you a lot less in both money and stress!"
472,0,2022-02-16,"...

The indicated range on any EV is only ever an estimate but with most it is an educated estimate in that it adjusts the indicated range based on how the car was driven over the recent past. Many of us call it a ""guestimate"" and the range indicator we often call the ""Guess'o'Meter"" or GoM  Drive the car hard then not only will you get less actual range but from then on the car will assume that it will be driven hard and the estimate will be lower. Drive the car gently for a period and the car assumes more gentle driving for the future and so the estimate will go up. 

Also... the faster you drive the less range you will get so you seeing a drop in indicated range reduction when you drove slower is to be expected."
465,0,2022-01-18,"The indicated range is a fiction. The max range is essentially the usable battery capacity multiplied by the car’s supposed efficiency. So if you can achieve 4 miles/kWh and have a 42kWh battery with 37.3kWh usable, then the range is 149 miles.

4 miles/kWh is pretty good this time of year and you probably won’t manage that. 3.5 is more realistic, so the range is then 130.

to get 199 miles from 37.3 kWh usable means hitting over 5 miles/kWh which is… optimistic. Then again it’s a city car by design so in summer, with very careful driving, you might manage it.

More realistic is just 4.3miles/kWh which gives you the 161 range.

The more I think about it, have they massively cocked up and stated the car’s range based on the full battery capacity rather than the usable capacity?"
704,0,2020-11-19,"Found this advisory suggesting import duties won't be an issue:

""If you have owned the vehicle for at least six months and lived outside of the EU for at least one year (185 consecutive days) and are moving back to the UK permanently, then you will not have to pay any import VAT or duty (which is nice.)In order to prove this we will require proof of US residency from at least one year ago, for example a utility bill, bank / mortgage statement and also proof of vehicle ownership from at least six months ago, for example an insurance certificate or title/registration document """

Car was announced last year was it not and appeared at dealers last month. That is almost another 5 months away. 
What was the cabrio roof like in the rain? Really noisy with the rain battering down? Only ever had a hard top convertible/roadster (Daihatsu Copen) so not familiar with day to day living with a canvas roof.

Would love to see an electric Panda. Guess they could base it on the same platform as the Corsa and 208 if the 500 platform isn't used. Give it the classic tall back end and stick as little possible past the wheels at each end.

2 months later, collected the car today. Guess what, no cable, only the granny charger.

Yes, exactly.

I think as time goes on and these systems age and become even more 'fussy' drivers in general are going to finally have to accept that the car in front might well stop suddenly without warning, as we hear of more and more rear-end accidents from this sort of thing.

TBH, that is no bad thing, to assume the car in front might suddenly decide (for itself and for no good reason) to brake to a stop.

These days an assumption has built up that the car in front should never stop or slow down if they are behind it."

However, sounds like you have ordered a 'stock car' so it may well have been ordered before Aug. I placed order with dealer in Sept for Nov delivery, but the original order was put on the system in May, so didn't come with the 2nd cable as standard.

@Wastedspacer what is the situation with the 500e, are the indicators white, red or amber?

If they cannot be adjusted, pair of headlamps on ebay for the car are £40 each and if you had to change the rear lights £25 a each, add a fog light and you should be done!

Having had a look at some UK Fiat 500 and the 500e (Thanks ebay.com) the units look pretty much identical i.e. the lenses don't appear to be coloured differently

204,0,2023-01-29,"OP the range estimate is not a 'tank level' indicator. It's a how far can I go if I drive it like this indicator. Many years ago I had a first generation range indicator on an XJ40.

That was the very best figure, though. Even under optimum conditions there was a ~9% range shortfall compared with the spec. In winter the range was only about 76% of the specification figure, so about a 24% shortfall.

That's comparable with some EVs. My car has a spec that gives a WLTP range of 292 miles, in reality is does around 270 miles in ideal conditions (an 8% shortfall versus the spec) and about 210 miles in worst case conditions (a 28% shortfall versus the spec).

Why does the type of CU make any difference?

Charge points are best wired via a connection box to the tails, not a good idea to wire one to a CU unless there is no other option, really. The reasons are mainly that few CUs have the capacity to add a double pole RCBO, or RCD and MCB, fitting a high continuous load circuit into a CU may present an increased risk from heat build up, particularly for older boards with plastic cases and often the wiring run can be simpler and less disruptive if it comes from the tails rather than the CU."

531,1,2021-09-15,"Sorry to crash this thread, but if I may, would like to add a couple of points on installing a home charger, that might be helpful.

There is a Government grant to help with the installation of a home charger, this usually covers 50% of the installation but there is criteria that has to be met, so worth checking that online.

To protect your energy suppliers street wiring to your property, there is a fuse, this fuse needs to be 100A to run your charger at 32A. This is the case in most modern property that the fuse is 100A but older property it can be only 80A, in which case you charger will be installed at 16A rating and charge your vehicle at only 3Kw’s per hour, after wiring loses. So this is worth checking, the good news is that your energy supplier should up grade this fuse, free of charge, but of course will require planning.

Charging loses, when charging your vehicle allow for about 10% of the electricity being drawn down through the charger to be lost in heat in the wiring and the vehicles inverter. For example, 6.7kw’s per hour comes from my charger but only 6Kw’s per hour actually goes into the battery. This is worth noting if you are calculating a window of cheap energy for overnight charging, to ensure there is enough to cover the miles next day.

I have a podpoint charger, I have had it 4 years and has been no bother, it’s okay but there are better smarter chargers out there now.

I didn’t know all this when I started out with EV’s, so just in case it is of help and good luck with you prospective purchase, once you have an EV, there is no going back."
394,1,2022-02-04,"As above, the Masterplug one sold by Screwfix is good value. I'd urge caution if using the portable charge point regularly though, as they are really intended as a ""get out of jail"" charging method, when a safer method just isn't available.

There are two potential issues with using one, the main one being that, unless the wiring and outlet is in good condition the plug may over heat. It's a fairly common issue with older wiring installations, so much so that many charge points now have temperature sensors in the plug to turn the charge point off if the plug over heats. The second issue is that a normal outlet most probably won't have the electrical safety protection that's needed to charge a car. There is a small risk that if there is an open PEN fault on the local distribution network then the car body could become live when plugged in. It's a small risk, though, there are only around 500 of these faults across the UK each year.

OK to use very occassionally, if you understand the possible risk, but I'd suggest that it wouldn't be sensible to use a portable charge point every night for months on end, as the more one is used the greater the chance of there being an issue."
540,1,2021-10-06,"I hope this helps anyone with similar issues .

Ensure that you are in an area that has a good internet coverage, proceed with a radio restart followed by a key cycle: from the radio menu: Vehicle> Settings> Reset> Radio restart.
Once the radio has restarted, do key off - key on.

Should you continue to experience any issues, repeat the radio restart + key cycle up to 3-4 times.

If this still does not work, then try with a further Factory reset: rom the radio menu: Vehicle> Settings> Reset> Factory settings.

Once the radio has restarted, do key off - key on.

The issue is solely to do with charging from a standard home outlet, using a 13 A plug in charge point. They draw a steady 10 A for hours on end, and sometimes that is just more than the outlet can safely handle, leading to overheating. There's also the small risk from an open PEN fault with charging like this.

A properly installed charge point will have all the required safety protection and will also be wired to a supply that can safely carry a high current for hours on end, so is a very much lower risk overall.

Public charging is just as safe as charging from a properly installed home charge point, and a lot safer than charging from a 13 A plug in charge point.."

Most EVSE installers would most likely take the feed directly from the tails at the meter (raul there than adding a new circuit to an existing consumer unit or fuse box), and use a small dedicated consumer unit just for the new charger circuit, to avoid the need to check/test/upgrade/replace the existing consumer unit. This allows the new install to be fully compliant with the regs and be fully tested independently of the existing installations. Obviously if there are issues with the meter position/cut-out that need addressing first then this work would be additional, but it leaves the existing consumer unit untouched."

The back seats of the 500e have never been used and probably never will be - a thoroughly unpleasant place to be, even for youngsters, IMHO.

This is interesting. How do you define home chargers and fast chargers? I am currently using my 'granny' charger at 2.3Kh whilst awaiting installation of my 'fast' home charger which will handle 7Kh. Is that what you mean by fast or are you referring to the very fast DC chargers?"

Look for a lever in the left hand side footwell, near the bottom door hinge. That should release it, but only partly.

It's true. My cynicism is more for amusement than disrespecting the cultural aspirations of 'The Fiat Panda'.

Indeed, if they sustain the basic design ethos then I agree with the sentimentality. The more variety of styles in car choice the better. 

We are facing the imminent danger of all BEVs heading towards indistinguishable pudding-shaped 80kWh cars, because nothing else quite works at the modal average of people.

Personally, I like big comfy low-riding 3-box limousines, but also tall narrow utilitarian vehicles/vans. So hurrah for the Panda! I have an increasing distain for anything that moves away from those polar opposites, as I think they are typically a compromise of mediocrity. donald's ideal driveway; Merc S 100kWh BEV and a Fiat Panda REx.

On the subject of whether my ideal driveway cars would have TPMS ... sure ... but I am not bothered either way, TPMS is for lazy people that can't be bothered to walk around their cars to check it is safe to drive off before getting in, or are not even competent to tell if their car is safe to drive."

It is, and it is to be welcomed, but not at the expense of causing other accidents.

This whole area is challenging to make morale judgements on, I was highlighting that difficulty because it is not so clear cut.

I am not saying better/worse, in fact I was 'actually' trying to say that one cannot declare one thing is better or worse than another, like, where you said better to be rear ended in a phantom braking event than running someone over. I don't think this can be said because one has to look at the likelihood versus severity, and if a car is phantom-braking 10 times an hour that is clearly worse than 1 phantom brake a day, which is worse than once in the car's lifetime. You've then got to decide, on the product of likelihood x severity, how many people survive being hit by a car, and how many die from being rear-ended (or rear-ending)."

Trip was typically nightmarish. We bought it from a garage in Cheshire about 100miles away. We asked them to fully charge it as we didn’t want to have to charge on our first trip. Despite a weeks notice and nagging them, when we turned up, it was sat on the charger. We left the dealership with about 60% charge. Thought we would pop into the local Morrison’s and use their charger. That was a bit of a mistake - the Friday crowd were in shopping and the charger is by the in ramp. Reversing across the traffic was a challenge! Had the usual first time charging a new car challenges but got to meet a lovely local guy in an iPace! Needless to say neither of us could get the Genie Point charger working (they had network problems). So gave up and set off.

Stopped at the osprey charger on the A55. It worked ok but it was getting dark and was raining by then.

The GOM has never gone over 161mi for me (I've in fact driven from north London to Brighton and back on a single charge, but it was summer and we went the slow way through London both ways)... I think that a 100mi commute shold be fine, although perhaps I'd recommend switching to 'sherpa mode' when the SoC gets under 20% just to be on the safe side.

Charging more slowly can be kinder to the battery, but to a point…
rapid charging (50+kw) most damaging but can still be done many times
but the charging you do at home/destinations (7kW 32A) doesn’t make much difference, the lower settings are there for people with restrictions, such as 60A home fuse, so not enough capacity to have a full 7kW 32A, instead they’ve got 3.6kW 16A outlet, or others only have a 13A socket, so use the granny charger, these are limited to 10A (but could be put down to 6A, if you have the settings/need to), to protect the wiring/socket/connection as you don’t usually have something at 13A running full chat for maybe 12hrs, causing any weakness to overheat & possibly set fire
Though the lower Amps you charge at, the less efficient the charging is, so that’ll cost more, but this is only a tiny amount

504,2,2021-08-03,"We have had a 500E La Prima for around 6 weeks now and we can confirm there are some issues which we suspect are SW related.

There are inconsistences with the relationship between battery charge level and range. i.e. We charged to 100% and the range dropped by 23 miles before the battery capacity reduced to 99%. The range then reduced by 2 miles when the charge level reduced to 98% Regardless of driving style I would expect there to be a more accurate correlation between these 2 measurements. 1% = 23 miles and then 1% = 2 miles is not very helpful.

The speed and range were set for MPH and and Miles respectively. 3 times now, these settings have randomly switched to Kmh and Km and had to be reset in the units settings. When I saw the speedo at 47 I though a speeding ticket would be arriving soon but then realised the display was in Km/h

With the car switched off and locked, when you plug in a charge cable the radio bursts into life for around 20 seconds.

The battery capacity varies quite a bit from charge to charge. On 17th July a 100% charge indicated a potential range of 205 Miles in SHERPA mode. On 30th July, 100% indixcated 165 Miles in SHERPA mode.

This is not SW related but we also have concerns with the E-Mode selection switch on the centre console. Twice now, my partner has accidentally put the car into SHERPA mode whilst I was driving around 70mph. This causes the car to suddenly brake and reduce speed to 50mph. The E-Mode switch is on the passenger side of the centre console. She mistook it for the volume control. In left hand drive vehciles this would not be such a problem.

I am logging these type of occurrences and will present them to the dealer and FIAT customer services as appropriate but it does look like there should, perhaps, have ben a bit more regression testing.

Other than that, we love the car and would recommend it."

The car drives beautifully and is very much like our current Fiat 500 (but without the 57k miles), firm and sure footed. The acceleration is nippy and the speed is more than acceptable for a quick dash down the M1. Couldn’t quite get the ACC and LKA to work properly but then we were both pressing and guessing. The seats are firm and much like the 500 that we have although I thought there was supposed to be more adjustment but couldn’t see it.

I bought a brand new Fiat Panda in 2005, about 3 months after a friend bought a brand new VW Golf. In the nearly 3 years I owned the Panda, nothing went wrong - except the brake discs rusting after I parked in torrential rain and left it alone for 3 weeks. 

My friend's Golf was in and out of the garage several times, a couple of times due to the fancy dual clutch automatic gearbox, DSG I think, which wasn't paired well with the 1.9 diesel and would sometimes stall (how do you stall without a clutch pedal?!), fanbelt failing after only 8000 miles, several times due to electrical issues, like the drivers window going down, but not up, brake light bulbs blowing 3 weeks after replacement, refusing to start without any indication as to why - the AA man said the battery was fine. Interestingly he's had the same problem with his current Skoda Kamiq.

She charges once a week as she only covers town driving and it costs her £8 with the Elli card/app. Electroverse is good too.

I don't mind safety systems (and to be honest I've found TPMS actually quite useful) - but I do mind all the junk they put inside.

Nobody needs 23 inches of touchscreens, web browsers, five zone climate control, televisions, or whatever to drive to the shops! How much of that stuff actually gets used?

Auto windscreen wipers, auto lights, cruise control (actually I don't even use that anymore), lane keep assist and good climate control. And ideally remote starting of the climate control. Then a few optional extras and job done 

Ah, actually....a reversing camera has become something of a must. But then maybe they'll buck the trend and make a car you can actually see out of when going backwards!

Its very clear that 'EV' options are an afterthought in the radio software. No way to 'charge now' if schedules are set (and who won't have scheduled charging if they have a dual rate tariff?), and most of the display cards seem fairly inaccurate.

I had a 2005 Fiat Panda, which was the basis for the 500 - it also had a button to make the steering lighter. A few years earlier, there was an amusing advert (for the Punto I think) that talked about it, a female driver said it made it nice and light so it was easy to park, the male driver said it had a special ""girly"" button. The girly button made it so light I could literally turn the wheel all the way around when stationary, using just my little finger. 

With electric assisted steering, it's very easy to adjust, unlike hydraulic assisted steering. Some say electric steering is numb, and vastly prefer hydraulic, but electric is way cheaper, lighter, and easier to package, so more and more new cars have it. If it isn't adjustable, that's probably just cost cutting, there's no good engineering reason to disallow it - all you need to do is adjust the motor power, which even my £20 screwdriver can do."

The fixed green light indicates that the battery portion is fully charged.

Gentle acceleration and deceleration (as in a petrol car) help extend the range. Don't forget the heater can use up to 3kWh of power in the winter when heating a cold car to 21degC. 60 mph on motorway will provide noticeable improvement.
What miles/kWh are you seeing on the trip meter display? (use the up/down arrows on LH side of steering wheel to access this display). You should be getting around 3 - 3.5 this time of year rising to around 4.5 in warmer weather."

Just found this post as I'm experiencing the same thing. Intermittently the speed sign on the dash displays as 18 in a 30mph zone, 24 in a 40mph zone, etc. So you're correct that for some reason it occasionally thinks the speed limit is in kmh for some reason and then converts that to mph to display on the dash. I don't know if that's because it's falling back to the sat nav, but it seems that once it starts doing it, it continues to display the speed limit incorrectly even when passing speed signs that are clearly visible. Very annoying as it's flashing away because according to it you're speeding!"

Nope. As I say the delay is VW trying to figure out how THEY can profit from this. They want to sell the fleet of V2G BEVs as if they were a power station to support the grid at peak times. They seem to have forgotten who owns the cars! 

For me CCS have gone down the wrong road saying you have to strap the inverter to the front of your house. They should’ve put the inverter in the car then any charing point could be 2-way. Many BEV manufacturers have ignored the official standard and use the Type-2 port for V2L, I wonder if/when a manufacturer will do the same with V2G?

Don’t forget the ChaDeMo V2G trials have gone on so long that ChaDeMo is obsolete before they got around to rolling it out…"

Ah, interesting; that explains a lot. I went to Brighton yesterday which for me was about 85 miles. If I couldn't get a charging point I planned a 20 min top-up at Cobham Services on the M25. As 90% of my journey was on the motorway, and they were clear, I spent the majority of that time at 70 mph. The 85-mile journey took nearly 140 miles off the 'range'. In the time I was there, I charged the car back to 85%. On the journey back I stayed at 60 mph and this time the 85-mile journey consumed approximately 105 miles of 'range'. 

I drove these journeys in the 'Range Mode' which did help. I note that in 'Sherpa Mode' the car asks you to limit the speed to 50 mph.

It's a learning curve I guess ......but it is still a great car!"

Hi, I am looking to swap the wifes car from a kia picanto to the fiat 500 electric Red edition. I am used to electric as i have had an Ipace for the last year. Does the fiat have programmable pre conditioning so the the heater comes on at a set time each day, can it be set via an app and manually in the car ?
My ipace has a heated screen but i have never used it as i set preconditioning every day before going to work, would this work the same in the fiat ?
Due to the wife wanting red interior, she cannot have heated seats, no idea why but there you are, so it would be an extra £300 just for the heated wipers, are these any good, and if the car pre conditions, do you need them.

I respectfully would say that 7 miles isn't a long journey to give a steady enough reading. You will have just set off, which takes an enormous amount of energy, possibly stop at road junctions and set off again. It's the same with a petrol car, the first few miles are the most thirsty. I travel 12 miles to work, the first few miles I'm getting 1.6-1.9 miles per kWh, after 5 miles or so it goes to 2-2.5 and by the 8 or 9th mile I'm at 3 miles per KWh and 3.6 by the time I arrive home or work. That's winter, in summer I get 5.2 to 5.6 miles per KWH, I've even had a couple of 6-6.2 miles per kWh but more typically 4.7-4.8. I always advise anyone contemplating an EV to buy the biggest battery version that can, because...winter."

There will always be a bit the wiper doesn't reach, on almost every car ever made - certainly every one I've driven in the past 25 years, which is quite a few. You just have to get used to it. It would be possible (for the manufacturer, not you) to move the hinge of the left wiper to the bottom left of the windscreen, and have it wipe the other way, so there would only be a tiny bit behind the mirror which isn't wiped - but this would mean the wipers would risk colliding, so nobody makes cars like that."

117,2,2023-01-06,Happens reasonably often on all the cars I have driven. My Tesla (radar system) used to trigger every day at two locations one seemed to be from from overhanging grass on one country lane and the other was a pair of large manhole covers. My current BMWI3 is optically sensed and a bit more random. The only true false alarms have been a combination of road repairs and reflected sunlight. In the end these systems are looking for anything which matches their criteria of an obstacle and it is inevitable that a system which must trigger in a true emergency will have some level of false alarms
249,2,2022-08-05,"I've noticed with my Ioniq if I leave it parked up for a few days unused, particularly if it was raining the last time I drove it. When driven again the brakes make a scraping sound but not a squeak, the sound clears after a few deliberate hard braking applications as the surface rust is removed from the disks.

Maybe arrange another test drive and deliberately overuse the brakes to see if the squeak reduces or even disappears. Demo cars may not be used very often so the disk surfaces have time to oxidise a bit."

Many people say something similar. The problem is, dig down and you find everyone's list of 'essentials' is a little different. Design by committee ends up including them all, and the result is a bloated product.

A genius design seems a little eccentric at first. It values simplicity, and makes you give up some things you thought you needed, but the end result makes sense as a whole, and you smile every time you use it. The new Panda EV could be such a thing, perhaps. We will have to wait and see."

You might want to look at the Ora Funky Cat - it has similar rounded styling to the 500 and Micra, and a significantly larger boot than the 500, still in a compact package. It's a lot more expensive than expected however. There aren't many small EVs - just the 500, Honda E, Corsa, 208, Mini, Funky Cat, and in a couple of months the BYD Dolphin. Of those, the Honda, 500, and Mini are probably too small, and also the best looking cars. Good luck squaring that circle!"

Somewhere I read that it will get under £20000 by employing a unique selling point. No infotainment system. You get a bracket and a power connection for your phone instead.

But under UK legal precedents (not saying those apply to you) if you were to wait for technical work to be done to arrive at some sort of result, this would be considered as being 'accepting the car [with pending faults for repair]' and you would lose your right of rejection.

Just very badly translated, I think. This charge point is advertised in countries in Europe that have load limiting trip switches on their incoming supply, like France and, I believe, Spain, as reducing the risk of blackouts, not as a way of providing power during them.

These load limiting trip switches are a pretty standard arrangement in parts of Europe, where the consumer can choose to pay a higher tariff in order to be able to draw more current from the supply. The original Italian advert makes it clear that the ""prevention of blackouts"" feature is just load limiting, so the charge point can be set to not allow the current drawn by the charger in the car to exceed the set supply trip current limit. Resetting the Italian equivalent of the French household interrupteur différentiel after it's blacked the house out because too much current has been drawn is a nuisance, one that this thing is designed to reduce."

There are some funnies with how different cars have implemented the charging standards and how chargers such as the Zappi interact with them. Generally the solution is to tweak the Zappi settings.

Well, if you didn't gather it is neither a software nor hardware 'fault', it is a system that may be set a bit over-sensitive. A 'design' fault if you will. There may be car settings to soften this behaviour in the menus, or maybe at the dealer.

Arnold Clark are that car dealer universally known for great service, NOT.
If you want to get contractual, remember your contract is with the supplying dealer, not FIAT. 
Reread the terms of the contract. Look for terms that say something similar to "" subject to survey"". If Arnold Clark or any if their agents performed the survey they are responsible for delivering a fit for purpose charger, including one with a lead long enough to reach the FIAT's charging port. If Arnold' Clark's agent ( this might be Wallbox) were negligent in their survey and did not measure the distance accurately, they are responsible under the terms of the contract which they signed to make good, I. E. swop for a longer cable.

Now it comes down to how you want to enforce the contract. You are looking at a cost of say £250 parts and £150 labour to replace the charging cable. Instructing a solicitor to write a letter might consume most of that with uncertainty as to whether you would recover all your costs. So get a quote for supply and replacement of a longer cable. Phone up your local trading standards officer and see if they can offer assistance or advice.

206,2,2023-01-29,"yeah you need to understand how the ""GOM"" works...

Different OEMs have taken slightly different approaches to how they display range. Tesla for instance seems to use the range meter as a bit more like a ""fuel tank size"" in that it always shows the same value when the battery is full. It doesnt account for how you drive or weather, it always uses the same fixed theoretical value to display remaining capacity. My old LEAF seemed to pay little heed as to how i drove the car, but did make some adjustments for weather, a warm day might say 100miles and a very cold one might say 70 or 80. In reality i was lucky to get 80 on the best days. The Merc and Enyaq both adjust their range depending on the last few miles driven (i dont know the sampling period exactly, but i would guess the last 10-20miles is used)

Each of these approaches has pros and cons.

If you take the Tesla approach, then you get the issue where the car says you have ""160miles"" of range, you drive 10miles up the road, and you've now only got ""130miles of range"". This gives you warm fuzzies when you get in and it shows 160miles, but makes you worried as the range is disappearing fast.

The last approach seems common amongst ""legacy"" automakers, as thats also how the fuel tank ""range"" estimates work in ICE cars, so i guess it makes sense to keep it consistent. It takes the consumption from the last few miles of driving, and then extrapolates that out to the full battery capacity. If you do that though, fully charged the car might only say ""80miles of range"", which people dont like as they might think their battery is somehow not fully charging, but at least its somewhat more accurate to what you will actually achieve on the road.

If you are doing short journeys and only drive 5 miles in freezing weather, the consumption will be extremely high due to the cabin heat (and possibly battery heating depending on the car). 

However if you actually drove a longer distance, the average consumption would be lower, as once the cabin and battery is up to temperature, the use drops off and thus the average falls.

It makes sense so long as you understand whats going on, and how your car displays the figures.

On average i seem to find i have about 25% less range in summer doing my 40mile commute. In summer the car will average around 3mi/kwh. in winter when its cold, ~2.3mi/kwh. I think thats a reasonable starting point/rule of thumb... However lots of very short journeys will likely make that worse."

Interesting efficiency comparison 500e vs M3 LR. We also have these cars (and an ID3...and a Honda NSX!) but I haven't taken the time you have to understand this. Surprising in some ways given Tesla are generally regarded as being ahead of the pack in terms of battery management / efficiency.

With the 500e, on a full (100%) charge, we also have been seeing ~150 miles range but I am hoping this will improve with the warmer weather (the ID3 has jumped about 15% over the last week).

For example, my BMW will go into charge delayed mode after about 9 on/off cycles. The reason for this appears to be protection of the 12VDC battery. Each start requires 12VDC output, and if there is insufficient time for the battery to recharge, then the computer steps in to protect the low voltage battery."

It took me 3 different computers to access the manual. My phone would open it from the QR code in the short printed guide, but not download it. If I shared the same URL to my laptop, I was given a login page (which seemed to know of 2 of my email addresses already, but wouldn't let me reset passwords, would register a 3rd email - but without a password, so that is lost too).
