0,Long Term Care of Your Tesla Battery: It’s Not Rocket Science (Maybe),91,"Feb 11, 2015","Introduction

As a Roadster owner, long time Tesla follower and even longer time engineer with experience of batteries and power systems, I thought I put together this little guide on the Tesla batteries and how to care for them. Hopefully this will be useful to the new influx of Tesla owners both as the Model S goes on sale and the Roadster reaches more affordable second hand prices.

Before spending serious money on my cars, I researched as much about the technology and the manufacturers as I could. In fact, I think I’ve probably spent more time researching this topic in the last decade than I have on any other subject, ever!

Nevertheless, as a systems engineer I have to be a bit of a jack-of-all-trades. There are probably specialist power engineers out there that have a more in depth knowledge about the topic than I do. I doubt this is exhaustive and I’d very much encourage feedback from other owners.

I've had to make this post multi-part due to the 6 pictures per posting limit.


Background

I’ve been involved with satellite systems engineering for over a decade. Specifically, back then I was systems engineer for the “bus” (service module) of the Surrey Satellite Technology Ltd GMP satellite platform, including the high level engineering of the power system. SSTL is a pioneer of using commercial technologies in the space field including batteries and Elon Musk was a 10% shareholder at the time.

The batteries that SSTL used were made from off the shelf Sony 18650 lithium ion cells and supplied by ABSL. Hundreds of cells were procured, tested, characterised by their performance and those deemed acceptable were assembled into strings, bricks and then battery modules of various multiples of series or parallel to get the voltage and capacity required. These modules would have their own internal safety and monitoring electronics. Battery modules might range from tens of cells up to several hundred and multiple modules might be used on a spacecraft. Such 18650 batteries have flown on Mars Express, Rosetta (the comet chaser recently in the news), Galileo and many other NASA, ESA and commercial spacecraft.

Those of you paying attention may have noticed this sounds familiar. Yes – it’s pretty much exactly the same way that a Tesla battery, or Energy Storage System in Tesla parlance, is built. So back in 2006 when a friend introduced me to Tesla, I was intrigued – and not entirely surprised – that they were taking the same kind of architecture we used and putting it in a car.


When you are designing spacecraft, you are very much aware that components have a performance at Beginning of Life (BOL) and End of Life (EOL). Some of the most important of these on a spacecraft are the solar arrays and the battery, both of which drop off appreciably in performance over the mission lifetime. The solar arrays will generate less power due to effects like radiation damage and the batteries will drop in capacity due to aging and repeated cycling. We design the power system so that the mission objectives can be met with EOL performance, meaning that at the beginning of the mission there is usually a surplus of power available.

It is important to note that different missions will see a different number of charge cycles – for example, in the case of a low earth orbit spacecraft like the International Space Station, this will be about 5000 cycles a year. Engineers of any electronic system powered by batteries know that there is a non-linear relationship between the Depth of Discharge (DOD) used and number of cycles the battery will last until the capacity reaches it’s EOL state (often 70% of new). They also know that the battery has to be kept within a set of temperature parameters for both storage and use to minimise aging. We were taught this at university: My copy of the satellite engineer's bible, Space Mission Analysis and Design, was published just as lithium ion was coming into use for spacecraft, but the principles are the same whether you are using NiCad, NiMH or Li-ion (see figure 11-11).

1,Long-term value of vehicle with transferable free supercharging,1778,"May 16, 2023","Hi - 

I am wondering if anyone has run across what look like credible calculations for the value of a vehicle that carries with it transferable free supercharging. Do the calculations take into account Tesla's strong under-cutting of the charging speed on some or all of the older vehicles with the free transferable supercharging?

Related question:
- Does anyone else here have an older Model S or Model X? If so, what supercharger power/speeds do you usually experience? (Mine are very low, max of about 70 kW and seem to get quickly below 50 kW).",8.0,0,645

3,Are the safety and dashcam features that good? The damage to my car says not,6590,"May 7, 2023","My wife was taking my daughter skating this morning. It was a little foggy and on a dual carriageway, she spots a deer dash out from the left, go into the right lane and then run back. She was braking from the moment she saw it... 

Final result is the front bumper with serious dent (foot wide, 4"" indented), passenger side wing is displaced and dented. And

The car didn't brake, didn't beep to warn of the impending collision, and apparently, this amount of damage is not enough to trigger the dashcam to automatically save the footage.

An attempt to manually save the footage didn't work - all I have is the image of my wife taking a photo of the dent. Oh and a van tailgating an overtaking car... had they got the deer it would have been a 3 car wipe out. 

Not convinced that any of these systems are helping....",21.0,2,1516

5,Music on SSD - weird behaviour,70918,"May 9, 2023","I have an SSD drive hooked into my 2020 M3, with a partition for music and another for dashcam footage. Music is grouped into folders per band and then folder per album. All works fine.

Recently I realised one album had some jumpy mp3s, from back when I digitised my vinyl. No problem I thought, just rerip the tracks and overwrite.

I did that, reinstalled the SSD, M3 scanned it... then I had two sets of tracks showing in the player! i.e.

Track 1 - a tune
Track 1 - a tune
Track 2 - another tune
Track 2 - another tune
etc

The funny thing is, each track was different - slightly different track length etc, indicating that the old and new mp3s were both registered. Each tune would play correctly even though the original copy had been deleted off the SSD.

OK I thought, there's some weird caching thing going on. So my next move was to delete the whole album folder then reinstall in the M3. It scanned again... and the duplicated album is still there! Its happily playing mp3 files which have been deleted.

Can anyone help me understand where these mp3s are stored and how to get rid of them?

if that is the case i am out from the start..... However all i can find on Google is that the free life time map updates ended in 2019/2020 and that would also be removed on 2nd hand sales...... From TESLA but no mention of other sales for 3rd party garages or private sales.

The Sentry mode changes seem to be getting criticised (instead of a flash, you get a minute of pulsating lights), the multi stahe heating on the steering wheel is nice, but only available on the M3 and MY. There are a few changes for other countries, mainly China.

It's the lack of USS replacement that is going to be the disappointment as it pretty much promised last year, and unless Tesla do a single stack FSD release using the 2023.2.xx convention (which they have been known to do), it's likely to be another 4-5 weeks before we see another release where the Tesla Vision parking sensors make an appearance.

I do a lot of short local trips so don't really need to charge everynight but what from what I've read online it seems Tesla do recommend charging to 80% every night. 

What I can't seem to find though is the impact this has on electricity bills, especially as I am on a standard rate. Is this advice to charge everynight aimed at those on an EV tariff with cheaper overnight rates?

47,Selling your Tesla,72644,"Nov 9, 2022","I have just been through a difficult week trying to sell/part exchange my Model 3 for my new model Y due for collection on 22nd November and I thought some of this might help others in the same situation.
I got notification of my delivery date options on 31st October and immediately set about trying to sell my current car.
I’d already decided on CarWow and Motorway as well as Tesla trade in. The first thing was a valet which made the car sparkle then take a load of photos. Motorway lets you add photos by uploading but CarWow made me use the app which was pointless as there is no mobile signal in our area so the app kept crashing. After emailing them they finally gave me a link to upload after two days wait.
Motorway were the first to come up with an offer. i have no idea how many they had but they just sent the highest. CarWow gave a valuation and links to four companies who had put what they might pay but I had to request a call back so I resisted for a while.
Some confusion arose with Tesla and I guess it was on my part. The instructions say to go to trade-ins, enter your details and then upload photos but I couldn’t see an option for that. In fact you need to return to your manage car page where there is now an upload option.
I then got an estimate from Tesla with a seven day acceptance, the same for Motorway with their one price and nothing at all from CarWow. I did get an email saying there was an offer and gave me a link but it only took me to a page saying the listing was closed. Eventually a phone call managed to get me a figure but it was lower than the others.
I now requested a call back from the dealer offering the highest figure from CarWows initial page but never heard a thing. However I did get an email from thecarbuyinggroup.co.uk offering to sell my car and offering to quote. I rang them and they were very keen and after taking some details promised to ring me back within half an hour. They didn’t and when I got a price it was £11,000 lower than anyone else! I assumed they were too embarrassed to call me back!
As the deadline approached I rung Tesla for my final figure before the deadline and spoke to a very helpful person called Tom. I explained my predicament and he said he would contact the trade-in department in the Netherlands (Yes, all trade-ins for Europe are handled there). However he warned me they worked on collection dates and my date was still four days away.
Imagine my surprise when ten minutes later my valuation arrived and I accepted it straight away as it was £1,00 higher than the others. Many thanks to Tom for his help.
One thing to those of you trading in with Tesla, they require at least one month remaining on the MOT which I wasn’t aware of.

55,MCU1 S/X - vehicle thefts,7228,"Oct 11, 2022","Hi

For those not on other forums; two MCU1 Model S have been stolen in the Sheffield area over recent days. One has been recovered. Information thus far appears to be that there is a vulnerability on MCU1 where the car can be tricked into thinking a new key has been made. This is not the key fob relay attack, and requires physical access to the vehicle - in both cases, the passenger side window has been smashed, the alarm silenced and the hack done. It takes ~30 mins to do.

MCU2 does not have this issue, however as the thieves have no idea if your car is MCU1 or 2 without ripping it to bits first, it doesn't really help much.

Tesla have been made aware, but this is a hardware issue so a fix might not be forthcoming quickly. If you have an affected vehicle, take steps to secure it (block it in with a 2nd car, add a steering lock, tracker, etc) ASAP.

It does not appear that 3/Y vehicles are affected.

57,Tesla pre-conditioning from battery only?,36553,"Sep 26, 2022","Is there any way to pre-condition the car using only cheap electricity? 
(use electricity from battery when outside cheap periods) 

My podpoint charge point wifi stopped working.  So it's now just a dumb charger always dispensing whenever car draws. 
I'm on Octopus Go with 4 hours cheap period. This translates to ~35% recharged over that 0:30 to 4:30 period. 

So currently it's on scheduled charging at 0:45 in the car as failsafe. Home Assistant sends API call to start charging from around 0:31 and if it's still charging at 4:29, send API call to end charging. 
Then in the morning, thanks to flexible working hours, my natural wake-up time varies. So I use Home Assistant morning routine to turn on pre-conditioning after I get up. Finally, unlock the cable on closing the front door. 

One thing I noticed is that on unlocking the cable, car stops drawing from charge point. I've yet to experiment with other actions. I'm wondering if other people have experimented with things like ""unlock cable and imminently start pre-conditioning"" or combination of any other actions to prevent the car drawing from the grid. 

How does in-car schedule departure work in combination with end of cheap period setting? I guess it start charging from calculated start time to reach target percentage before end of cheap period. Then does it draw from grid for the scheduled departure? 

I understand not using battery when plugged in is by design. This is to maximise range. But in day-to-day usage, where my daily commute is only 20-25%, I don't need to maximise range. I want to minimise cost and use cheap electricity that is already stored in the battery.",8.0,0,3024

A fundamental one is that the navigation seems to use road names most of the time, instead of numbers (major UK roads are numbered e.g. A6, M1; in Milton Keynes we have a grid of H6, V3 etc.). Tesla invariably uses the names in turn-by-turn navigation, which is hard to follow because it's numbers that appear in road signs, and painted on the road. Nobody uses road names. Even knowing when to leave a motorway is sometimes difficult, because instead of ""Junction 8"" it'll say ""St. Helen's"".

A record setting first generation Tesla Roadster on BAT auction sale took place early this year, with a $190K sale, and just three weeks later, on our site, the record was broken again with another Roadster sale over $250K. 

Both of these cars sold well over the original $106K – $160K MSRP, and the story behind these sales is detailed in our latest YouTube video.

Ironically, this last, most recent Roadster sale, exceeds the $250K MSRP of the upcoming 2nd generation Roadster, the world’s fastest production car waiting to be released.

It also is a clear indication the first generation Tesla Roadster is drawing interest from collectors and is in a bull market.

Tesla drivers left unable to start their cars after outage


The carmaker's CEO Elon Musk acknowledged the app used to gain entry into the car had malfunctioned.



www.bbc.co.uk








Tesla drivers say they have been locked out of their cars after an outage struck the carmaker's app.
Dozens of owners posted on social media about seeing an error message on the mobile app that was preventing them from connecting to their vehicles.
Tesla chief executive Elon Musk personally responded to one complaint from a driver in South Korea, saying on Twitter: ""Checking.""
Mr Musk later said the app was coming back online.
The Tesla app is used as a key by drivers to unlock and start their cars.
Owners posted a multitude of complaints online about not being able to use their vehicles.
""I'm stuck an hour away from home because I normally use my phone to start [my] car,"" one owner tweeted.

Click to expand...

This strikes me as being bollocks. No one gets ""locked out"" of their car if the app goes down, as the car locks, unlocks and starts using proximity detection with a paired phone, using BLE, so doesn't need a connection to the Tesla mothership AFAIK. It wasn't at all unusual for me to be in a ""no signal"" area, so no possible connection to the Tesla mothership, yet the car would lock, unlock and start just fine. It smacks of a bit of sensationalist reporting from a news organisation that should know better. Also shows how stupid some people are if they assume that not being able to use the app means they cannot get into their cars.",72.0,2,5823

I’ve bought a personalised number plate and so will be changing the plates. 

I’ve ordered two vinyl plates for the front and rear. The guy doing my ceramic coating said he’d add them. I sent him a video where the owner took the number plate holder off the front.

Are there any negatives for using vinyl without the holder eg number plate not being read by readers entering car park etc

I don't want to be alarmist, but I'm alarmed at how Tesla operate in general from something I discovered today. If you've recently ordered a Tesla and are pending deliver, you should spend some time going through it with a fine tooth comb looking for faults.

In summary - what appears to be happening with Ex China Teslas

They are leaving the factory unfinished. Adecco (employment agency) are looking for workers at Zeebrugge port in Belgium to finish off the build. These agency workers will get 1 x days training, after which they are called 'Tesla mechanics' (I mean, seriously!?)

They will then finish your car.

They are starting work shortly (add has been up for a couple of weeks now) and will work for a few weeks while a huge batch of Q1 European Tesla orders from China arrive on 5 boats. I have it on good authority from a very reliable source that there are 5 boats destined for Europe, so quite a large number of cars.

If you've recently ordered a Tesla and are expecting delivery - there is a chance that your car is being finished by an unemployed agency worker who will have been given 1 days training which apparently, makes them a 'Tesla mechanic'

Not to be elitist or anything - I'm sure they will train them well, and some of them might actually have experience....but just be aware and when you take delivery - go over it with a fine toothcomb. Last thing you want is to take delivery and then find a lot of other buyers find themselves fighting over service appointments to get any issues fixed, taking your brand new car off the road.",60.0,1,7570

Some additional sleuthing by owners this afternoon reveals that a supercharger is going to be installed at Tankersley Manor by the M1 near Sheffield (groundworks started; live by end Feb), and strongly suggests that The Cheltenham Chase Hotel (easy access from the M5) is also going to get one (because Q Hotels website lists Norton Park, Tankersley Manor and Cheltenham Chase as sites that will shortly be getting chargers).

This is all great news. I'm not sure I'd expect the pace to continue like this though - it sounds like a huge burst of effort was expended last year following Ecotrictygate and it's now all bearing fruit at once. Happy to be proved wrong though!

Tesla's trade-in offer is way too low (I don't class the repair as 'significant so for now haven't mentioned it'), but one of the car buying services (not WBAC!!) has offered near to the threshold I have set myself in order to justify the financial hit I'll be taking in ditching my current EV which is a 21 plate.

I am confident, that submitting details of my current vehicle to Motorway will solicit a bid that will tick the box I need to go ahead with the M3 purchase, but I cannot take photos until the paintwork is done and that will be in about 3 weeks time, but by then I might have missed the boat (so to speak) and have to wait longer for a M3.

The longer I wait, the more of a hit it is going to be on my current two-month old car!

144,Revealed: UK top 10 Tesla hotspots,93339,"May 15, 2021","Stockport has been crowned as the UK’s capital of Tesla’s (TSLA), having more licensed vehicles of the electric car brand than any other local authority in Britain.

According to new DVLA research by car leasing comparison website LeaseLoco, the town in Greater Manchester has a total of 2,257 licensed Teslas, more than in Wales (690) and almost as many as the whole of Scotland (2,367).


LeaseLoco submitted a Freedom of Information (FOI) request to the DVLA , asking for data on the number of licensed Teslas, and the location of where they were licensed.

The results showed that of the 41,314 licensed Tesla cars across England, Scotland and Wales, six other local authorities have more than 1,000 registered Teslas.

Seizing the silver medal was Hertfordshire at 1,946, with Leeds (1,833), Swindon (1,397), and Hillingdon (1,263) making up the top five.

Surrey and Milton Keynes both had more than 1,000 licensed Tesla vehicles, with 1,137 and 1,049 respectively. Watford (958), Hampshire (909) and Essex (827) rounded off the top 10 local authorities.

The regional data showed that a quarter of licensed Teslas — or 10,207 — were in the South East of England, followed by London with 6,810, while there were only 487 in the North East. West Somerset had the fewest number of Teslas, with just five.

Across London boroughs, Hillingdon had more than twice as many licensed Teslas as the next borough, Westminster (514). Barking & Dagenham (26) has the lowest number.

Top 10 Tesla hotspots:


Stockport - 2,257

Since I got hold of this Model S about eight months ago:

a) I am unable to get the ventilation fan setting to start up with the vehicle and remember my setting. Typically I like to ride with the fan at about four, and the vents open to the outside. The vehicle seems to default to a setting of one. I did find a discussion where other drivers are running into this:









Fan speed keeps resetting


I like to keep my AC fan speed around 4 or 5 but whenever I charge my Model S overnight or let it sit for a day the fan speed resets to 1 the next time I get in to drive it. I have done both a soft and hard reset. Before version 9 upgrade, it never did this. This happens to anyone else?




teslamotorsclub.com





However, this doesn't in the end fix the problem, it just explains it. Does anyone have a workaround other than just trying to remember to add an extra step each time I start up the vehicle, and other than waiting for Tesla to get around to realizing that a vehicle that costs in the neighborhood of USD $70k and built by a computer-savvy company should be able to remember what fan speed I want and give it to me, without making me remember to reset it each time I start the vehicle, or go through oxygen deprivation for the first few minutes of every drive, for years.

b) May I ask what strategies others follow to get answers directly from Tesla on this sort of thing? I've been on the phone a few times with them and when I reach the right person it's great, but when I just want some relaxed technical assistance and to ask questions, and not some roadside emergency type of call, I'm not sure how to get in touch (which phone number to dial, which response path to follow in the phone system) with the right people.

c) again, maybe they think they are computer savvy, but they have to this day not been able to fix their computer system so that it properly recognizes the phone number on my account. Oh well.",0.0,0,564

I was lucky enough to get added to FSD Beta a few releases ago... This is the first time in the program that Tesla has allowed participants to share our experiences to the public and I have shared a few of my drives on Twitter, but uploaded my videos to my YouTube (which was originally meant to share unlisted videos with family)... So, I will use this thread to update the SpeakEV community on some of the drives as I share it on YouTube and Twitter.

I would like to stress that FSD Beta is a driver assist system AND NOT AUTONOMOUS. As the operator of the vehicle, I remain in control and responsible for the drive.

I don't normally record my drives, so my early videos had to wait until my better half was able to join me on the drive and act as my camera person. I have since modified one of my old phones to record the drives, so my better half doesn't have to do the camera work.

""Mr Lewis, 
Further to our call earlier, our trade in valuations team noted a valuation error for your trade in vehicle. The correct trade in price for your Hyundai Kona is £26,100, we understand this represents a significant drop from the price expected and wanted to give you the opportunity to decide how you wished to proceed. 

You may continue with the purchase of your Model 3 on the basis of the corrected trade in figure, in which case an additional payment of £7,400 will be required. We can reschedule your collection to allow time for this additional payment to be made if necessary. 

If you would now rather dispose of your existing car elsewhere, we can remove the trade in from your purchase and continue as a full cash purchase, with an additional payment of £33,600 or explore some finance options. Again, we can postpone collection if necessary. 

We would like to once again apologise for the situation and the notice period of which you were informed. We also understand that you may no longer wish to continue with your order, and if this is the case, we will arrange the return of the funds already paid back to you. 

Please advise how you would like to proceed with your order, and we will make the necessary arrangements. 

Kind Regards,

In no particular order:

Handling: The S feels more stable at higher speed, a more luxurious, sedate drive. The 3 more sporty, aggressive, better cornering and road holding. When you floor the 3 especially round a curve, you can feel the car skip as the traction control kicks in. My S has lower power/weight so I don’t see this behaviour. At high speeds on my private road the 3 does bounce around, I have had some pilot induced oscillations/brown trouser moments.

Steering: Even on Comfort mode the 3 feels tight, feels like less turns lock to lock (I need to check). So much more a sports car, whereas the S is like driving Grampa’s XJS even on Standard mode.

Noise: More road noise from the 3 at lower speeds and similar levels of wind noise at higher speeds. The S may be slightly quieter, but they are both noisy cars.

Smell: The 4 year old S still smells of leather, whereas the 3 has more of a synthetic/plastic smell. So subconsciously feels less luxurious.

Seats: The 3’s seats are softer, hug your body, whilst the S feel more like a firm leather sofa. The S would suit a larger driver more.

Boot: I miss the hatch on the 3. Not because of needing to fit washing machines in the back, but ease of access. The Y will be much better in this respect. I love the powered boot of the S.

Road presence: People move out of the way for the S, Audis/BMWs are more likely to give you space. With the 3 you feel more ordinary, nobody notices you in the same way as the S. You don’t get any Tesla waves...

AP1 and 3: I have spoken about this on another thread. In short I prefer AP1. More consistent, less twitchy than the 3. Less false positives (bridges). Lane change a joke with the 3. No summon.

User interface: The 3 clearly has the lead, speed, computer games, Netflix, fires up quicker. 4 years makes a big difference.

Ease of access: The 3 has better access/less complaints from ageing parents.

Size: The S feels too big for UK roads and car parks. The 3 is much better in this respect. The inside does not feel much smaller. It seems like Tesla have made better use of inside space with the 3.

Storage: Much better in the 3, side pockets, better centre console, coat hooks.

Inside lighting: The S has nicer ambient lighting. A great reading light at the rear, great for kids who like reading and does not disturb the driver.

Charging: 3 much faster on the Superchargers, but not free! Powered port, nice to have.

Navigation: I like the fact that on the S you get the detail on the small front screen. This means I can have the audio nag off. The centre screen on the 3 does not give enough detail. 

I thought when we got the 3 I would become disillusioned with my old S, but actually I still love it. The 3 may be newer but it feels like the cheaper car it is. I enjoy the luxury of the S.

Clearly a lot of the comments above would not be relevant to the new S, but that is not the comparison I am making here. A new S is nearly twice the cost of a M3.",13.0,5,1790

Tesla fans have long argued that with such a huge head start in electric car sales it can’t be caught by legacy OEMs, but that theory was blown out of the water in July, according to respected auto market analyst firm, Jato Dynamics.
While electric vehicle (EV) sales accounted for 18 percent of the total sales in Europe in July, Tesla sales cratered by 76 percent to just 1050 sales in the month.
The Covid-19 pandemic might have smashed global auto sales in the first half of the year, but its impact was far lower on electrified, plug-in cars.
EV registrations in Europe were up 131 percent year on year, to 230,700, in July.
The Renault Zoe was by far the highest-selling EV in Europe in July, with 146 percent year-on-year growth, but there was not a single Tesla in the top 10.
Renault sold 9280 Zoes in July, followed by the Hyundai Kona (4405, with 111 percent growth), the Volkswagen e-Golf (4094).
Total EV registrations in Europe jumped from 23,400 sales in July 2019 to 53,200 in 2020, with the models on offer climbing quickly from 28 models in 2019 to 38 this year""

You shall pay:

‘As compensation and/or liquidated damages for your failure to comply with the terms of this Agreement, the total of the outstanding Rentals under the Agreement, less (a) the net proceeds of the sale of the Vehicle, that is after deducting the costs and expenses (including VAT) of tracing, repossession, insurance and sale and (b) a discount of 4% per annum on Rentals paid before the date on which they were originally due’.

I get the first bit about the total of the outstanding Rentals but it’s the next bit about less the net proceeds of sale and a 4% discount that I can’t fathom (my bold for emphasis).

Taking approx figures from my contract if I bail out after 3 years of the 4, I’m in for 12 months rentals totalling £10k. Assume car has depreciated by 50% so worth £45k. Assuming 4% discount on the 12 months I’m due to pay on termination reduces the £10k to £9.6k.

If I’m in for £9.6k less the sale proceeds of £45k the only conclusion I can reach is I walk away not having to pay the £9.4k. That sounds great but can’t be correct, what am I missing?

244,question about Tesla disabling supercharging,1778,"Feb 26, 2020","Hi -

I'd like to be more clear as to under what circumstances that Tesla says it will disable supercharging, and then whether the reality differs from what they say. I'm concerned that I've heard hard-to-confirm stories about Tesla disabling supercharging when customers have bought a used Tesla from someone other than Tesla, but that there had been reason to believe that supercharger access came with the purchase.

Is Tesla saying in those cases that

the seller knowingly misrepresented the supercharger access status?
the seller did not know supercharger access status?
the vehicle was declared a wreck, (and the VIN indicates this?), and supercharging cannot be enabled safely?
they have just decided to disable it because the latest buyer did not explicitly pay them for access?
On a related note, does Tesla publish a phone number or email where one can contact them to get information about a used vehicle one is considering buying (such as whether there will be a problem with supercharger access once a person has bought the vehicle?)

edit/addendum:

same questions for full-self-driving software.

I just noticed this recent article which helps capture some of why I am asking this question:

The more worrying aspects however are they now want to exclude drops in capacity or charge rate as a result of a software change as opposed to degradation. #batterygate and #chargegate owners will understand the concern

Secondly, they've updated myTesla to the NEW document even if its not applicable to the date your car was manufactured. As it only happened yesterday its anyones hguess whether they will try and apply the new rules to old cars.

The suggestion is that if you're already charging and a second car plus in to the same pair, a bigger drop in your charge rate may be observed.

Old behaviour: power supplied to each pair of stalls in a Supercharger is divided into 4 ""chunks"" (about 30 kW per chunk for 120 kW chargers, presumably up to 37.5 kW per chunk at higher power 150 kW chargers). If a car is charging fast enough to be using all 4 chunks and a second car plugs in to the same pair, the most the second car will receive is 1 chunk, or ~30 kW (now up to 37.5 kW?). The first car may see a drop to a minimum rate of ~90 kW (or ~112 kW) if it was previously charging at over that rate.

New behaviour (speculation): car 2 now takes 2 chunks of power so car 1 could see a 50% drop in rate when car 2 plugs in.

For those driving without Autopilot, Tesla registered one accident or crash-like event for every 1.92 million miles driven. By comparison, the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration’s (NHTSA) most recent data shows that in the United States, there is an automobile crash every 492,000 miles. While NHTSA’s data includes accidents that have occurred, our records include accidents as well as near misses (what we are calling crash-like events).

An article I read recently mentioned briefly something about Tesla ""controlling"" prices, and while I don't have the article to hand, the idea resonated for me. In the past this control took an obvious form (the resale value guarantee). I suppose it's also there in how they make it difficult and expensive to repair some vehicles, while providing some incentive to have some vehicles declared a total loss. They also seem to have discouraged, so far, a widespread culture of others working on Teslas to repair them, though I may be off in some of this perception, and anyway, I'm not sure how some of this would play out, positive or negative, for Tesla used prices.

I can say if I go here to their latest filing:

I was planning on buying a new or used MS early next year though I had pretty much decided to get a new M3 instead... until I recently learned that Teslas do not engage regenerative braking on pressing the brake pedal. Firstly, is this correct? Secondly how do people find it? I like to drive fast and therefore inefficiently occasionally, but most of the time I like to squeeze as many miles out of every kWh of battery as I can. I am not attracted to the high regen one pedal driving thing as ""feathering the throttle"" (anachronistic term now I suppose) to coast is difficult to get spot on and you will usually be powering or regenerating by a couple of kWh when you actually want to coast and this is inefficient. I do this in my Volt but what I really like about my Mercedes B250e (Tesla running gear) is that you can turn regen up or down, including to zero, with the paddles on the wheel. I use this a lot and barely use the brake pedal but when I do, it still uses regen. I am keen to hear other people's opinions and experience of this as currently I am rather put off a Tesla because of it. Perhaps I am being a bit precious or too much of a purist and the Tesla system works well? Can you easily adjust regen on the fly? Can you designate one of the manual controls to change it rather than going through the menus on the touch screen?",10.0,0,1640

Some minor points that are kind of pushing me a little toward buying from a local dealer, or buying new, even though in theory I like the idea of buying used directly from Tesla.


there is no really good way to browse within Arizona for a used Model 3, that I can find (virtually nothing comes up). If I plug in my zip code a moment ago on used model 3s, there are no choices. If I change to San Diego zip code, there are 71 choices.
There is a $2,000 fee for having the car shipped to one's state from out of state. If I did buy from California, I would either have to pay the fee or go through a one or more day ordeal of turning over my trade-in to Tesla on the same day as flying to some far-away place, or driving for a day or two, to the place.
I can't seem to see clearly marked on each ad in which state the vehicle is located, even though the $2,000 fee is clearly marked. How can we weigh if we would want to pay the fee or make the ordeal if we can't see the state?
Would it be possible to maintain some modest inventory of used Teslas in Arizona so that these travel/hassle/fee concerns are reduced?

A couple of weeks I'm planning on driving from Leeds to Budapest in my Model 3 performance. With supercharger stops its about 1300 miles. I'll be going through France, Belgium, Germany, Austria and into Hungary.

Has anyone got any tips here? I've done a few hours of research, here's what I've got so far, this is mostly related to having an EV / Tesla:

Supercharging, people say its quicker to not fully charge each time and just top up if you can easily reach the next supercharger. At what percentage does the charging rate start to really slow down? 70 - 80%

Should I only use superchargers in those countries or should I try to use the public charging network as well?

We're planning on doing around 400 - 450 miles a day and stopping off at hotels twice. Is a hotel with charging recommended, even if its out of the way. I'm worried that we'll drive out of the way somewhere and then get it and not be able to use the charger.

Adaptors? The model 3 has type 2 and CCS ports. I've seen that some people carry a chademo adaptor. Is it easy to buy a Euro adaptor for my UMC charger? I could use that at a hotel if I get desperate.

Taking a spare tyre. The performance versions has skinny 20"" tyres that are more prone to punctures and they are harder to source. At least if I have a tyre myself, I can get any local tyre garage to change it straight away, I won't have to wait for the tyre to be ordered in.

Is breakdown cover necessary? I have the Tesla cover included but I hear its slow. Is it worth getting short term European breakdown cover or is it just a waste of money?

Should I forget my electric Euro dream and just use my trusty 6 year old diesel Freelander 2 instead?

I prefer AP1. I use it only on dual carriageways and motorways, it has never tried to kill me and is very smooth and is happy to change lanes.

AP2.5 and 3 I find very nervy, will regularly brake for no reason under gantries and bridges. Hates changing lanes, to the extent I find auto lane change pointless. I find the acceleration and deceleration too much in stop/start or erratic traffic. They all suffer from lack of anticipation, I would have thought the later versions would be looking further ahead and would be less likely to accelerate towards stopped or slower traffic. AP2 and 3 will punish you and remove autopilot for the rest of the journey if you are too slow to wiggle the steering wheel.

I am sure 3 is cleverer and has more potential however given most people only use it as a sophisticated cruise and lane control then AP1 is all you need and does it very well.

I booked my car in via the app at West Drayton (potentially the busiest SC in the country). I could choose a range of dates from about two weeks out. I could also look up availability at the other SCs if the dates available didn’t work for me.

I entered a summary of my issues in the app and could select multiple categories. In my case I had a sticky charge port flap and some other minor items for them to investigate.

As I was away on leave I didn’t need a loaner. The car was booked in for the Tuesday and I flew out on the Saturday. So I just left my car in the car park and put the keys through the letterbox.

On the Tuesday morning I got a text message confirming they had received the car and I could respond by text if I had any questions.

Interestingly on the app it gives me a forecast for completion of work by 30 August.

382,Having difficulty believing in autonomous driving tech....,5455,"May 3, 2019","Driving to work today, I was tied up in the normal heavy, but slow moving suburban/urban traffic.

All around people driving their cars were voluntarily ceding their 'official' priority on the road to let people out of side roads, give space for people pulling U turns, waiting a bit longer than needed to allow people to cross the road, making space for bicycles coming up the inside and generally being considerate and respectful of other road users. These moves were sometimes indicated by a little wave, or maybe a flash of the lights, but also often simply by a pause or deceleration that allowed a space to open that allowed someone else to slip in.

It all worked and while nobody was getting anywhere fast, we were all making progress with relatively minimal stress.

What I'm having difficulty understanding is how these very human, social interactions, dependent as they are on mutual understanding and knowledge of how these situations 'work', can be replicated by autonomous driving systems.

How will my FSD AI know that someone just gave it a wave and that that specific wave means that it has a very short window in which to nip out in front of someone who formerly has right of way ? How will it distinguish that wave from a wave of thanks or someone having a vigorous hands-free phone conversation ?

It just seems beyond the realms of the feasible to have an AI reading and responding to the subtle social cues that humans make and receive in these situations.

As such, I do have to wonder what will happen when people start to let their AI drive them to work. I can rapidly see a situation developing where an AI, bereft of this social intelligence, fails to respond in a way anticipated by real human drivers around it. As strongly social animals humans are very highly trained to be sensitive to such cues and are also strongly conditioned to punish those that fail to abide by them. I can anticipate that even a small proportion of socially inept AIs on the roads will trigger anger and frustration in the surrounding human population. This risks increased human aggression towards AI cars and further hesitation and paralysis by risk averse AI systems...

I hope I'll be wrong. But I just have some serious doubts that AI-driven autonomous driving is ever going to work in a context where it is having to mix it up with a significant population of human drivers.",21.0,4,1568

We had the chance to spend a week in the south of Spain, near Malaga. On the way down we took it easy, stopping overnight. The way back, not so much. Decided to do the whole leg to Barcelona in one shot.

Trip planner predicted around 11 hrs including charging stops. This turned out to be pretty accurate, although we took around 12 hours because we stopped a bit longer to eat and play.

Most of the stops demanded charging for 20-40 minutes. Faster charging is going to be a pain because we’ll have even less time for comfort breaks!

The day before we headed to the mountains and on the way back took this road:

















The car managed the whole route on AP, handling tight hairpin turns without a problem. I was monitoring it but didn’t have to intervene until the end.

At the start of our 1,000 km trip I saw one of those ICE fires. Apparently they can’t cope with going uphill:










Loads of decent Supercharger stations have been installed in the last year, like this one at Granada. It even has a solar roof.










Amazingly, even with two young kids in the back the drive was a breeze. I didn’t feel like I’d spent the day driving, just enjoyed the scenery, ate some food and listened to some music. Very relaxing.

PALO ALTO, Calif., April 03, 2019 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Tesla is making significant progress in the development of its autonomous driving software and hardware, including our FSD computer, which is currently in production and which will enable full-self driving via future over-the-air software updates. With a number of very exciting developments coming in the weeks and months ahead, Tesla will host investors on the morning of April 19th at our headquarters in Palo Alto to provide a deep dive into our self-driving technology and road map.

Investors will be able to take test-drives to experience our Autopilot software first-hand, including features and functionality that are under active development. Investors will also hear directly from Elon Musk, as well as VP of Engineering, Stuart Bowers, VP of Hardware Engineering, Pete Bannon, and Sr. Director of AI, Andrej Karpathy.

The event will be webcast. Additional details forthcoming.

I've got a Powerwall on the way as part of the referral scheme and was wondering if anyone has experience of how they interact with a car on charge.

Ideally I would like the Powerwall to charge up from solar until it is full, or near enough.

At that point I would like it to use any surplus solar power to charge up the car, assuming it is connected.

My guess is the car will just suck all the power it needs whilst connected until it his the charge limit.

On a good sunny summers day the setup I'm planning should generate 25kwh's so, taking the Powerwall 12kwh's I would like the surplus to go into the car. Would much rather this than do the feed-in-tariff - would be great to be fully off-grid!

436,RFID pouches for key fob failing after 6 months - WARNING !!/??,2207,"Jan 9, 2019","Just a warning - when all the fuss was about people using relay attacks to steal Tesla's I got two faraday-cage/rfid-blocking wallets/pouches to keep my fobs in. They worked fine, nothing I did in all rotations of the pouch and angles of approach to the car allowed the car to detect the pouched fob until I opened it and pulled it out. Ooh er missus!

Now however after 6 months or so I notice the car can usually detect me approaching even though the fob is still inside its pouch.

I've not tried the other never touched pouch/fob yet but wondering if the material inside the pouch wears out after a while - e.g. the wire mesh breaks in places allowing signals to leak. It could be Tesla have changed something about the signal and the pouches are more leaky. Its not all the time so I'm feeling its more the former - damage to the mesh.

This is my original key fob - I didn't get the upgraded fob's which got reported because the SC didnt know anything about them when I asked - unless I got them already. I got my car in June 2018 so it might have come with it already or perhaps the firmware in the fob got upgraded wirelessly from the car the next time they were used after a car OTA update.

Has anyone else noticed similar or if not it might be worth checking as you might be vulnerable again.

600,000kms in the car and reckons he will be in it for another 300,000! For the imperial among us it is 376,000 miles! Got him to flick it to miles and took a pic of it.

He cannot see himself going back to an ICE, will be getting another S and hasn’t seen the 3 in the Helsinki showroom yet. 2 big bills in that time, MCU at 2,500€ and strangely power steering at 5,000€, other than that no real issues. Saves himself 1,500-2,000€ a month on fuel, and the penalty for limited range is he guesses he passes up a fare a couple of times a year, as someone wants to go 300km.

No X for him as he cannot see the doors working well for him in the rain, too much time open and too exposed for the weather. His previous Volvo lasted for 350,000km with the warranty gone early in that he was always worried about a big and painful bill, with the 8 years on the Tesla he figures he is more than covered on the expensive bits. It is still on the same battery, forgot to ask him what a full charge gave in Km to get a sense of degradation.

My car is a 2014 model, with the old ""Baolong"" type of TPMS, and if the car end of it had died then Tesla might have replaced it with the new type (""Continental"") to repair the fault, so I would then have ended up with twice as many TPMS to throw away because they no longer matched the car.

So, I agreed to order the TPMS from Tesla along with the wheels, and go for a service appointment to get the fault fixed and then pick up my wheels with the right sort of TPMS; they said they were too busy to fit the tyres for me that day even if I had wanted it (which I didn't because I assumed it would be more expensive). I had the tyres in the back of the car just in case.

Then on the day they found that the fault was indeed a dead sensor and replaced it. However, they then claimed that the wheels would not fit in the back of the car given that I already had the tyres in there - apparently the wheels come in huge boxes (there still looked to me to be quite a lot of space, and this is a 2014 RWD so there's the larger frunk that will take a wheel, not to mention the front seat). Somehow, unpacking the boxes to squeeze them into the car was considered more time consuming than mounting the tyres on the wheels, so even though they'd originally been too busy to do that, I ended up with the set fully installed by Tesla and only supplied the tyres themselves that I'd bought online.

Costs:

Wheels (19"" 'turbine' style): 4 @ £220.83 = £883.32 + VAT = £1059.86
TPMS (old type) 4 @ £54.17 = £216.68 + VAT = £260.01
Wheel centre caps 4 @ £10.83 = £43.32 + VAT = £51.98
Tyres (Nokian WR A4 245/45 R19 102V XL) 4 @ £130.25 = £521.00 + VAT = £625.20
Mount & balance labour (Tesla) £60 + VAT = £72

Grand total £1724.32. + VAT = £2069.18

Notes:

Wheels - I'd ordered the standard wheels like the ones already on the car (these are the ones with the square-ish spokes, I believe officially called ""slipstream""). However, what they actually fitted were the 'turbine' style - the service guy came out very worried when he spotted this on the car when they'd just finished fitting them and I'd already been waiting 4 hours! It turns out they are the same price, and I actually like the turbines better (they used to be extra cost when bought with the car, so I hadn't considered them).

Install labour - I can't make sense of this on the invoice. The £60 price was originally quoted to me as a price for doing 3 wheels (at one point they'd lost one of the sensors!), but is on the invoice for the set of 4. However, in the separate part of the invoice for the 'repair' on the existing wheel/sensor, they have only charged me for the TPMS part and no charge at all for labour. Correct? Mistake? Discount because they kept changing the story? So it's not exactly clear what Tesla's price is, but it's not huge - getting them fitted by a local tyre shop might have come in slightly cheaper but maybe not worth the bother.

TPMS - these are very expensive! You can get a third-party set of equivalents for just £127.35 inc VAT here (or here for more recent cars). These third party ones aren't just a different price for the same thing, they are a 'universal' one that the supplier has programmed up to transmit the same signals as the original single-function ones. Still, I think I'd probably have been happy with these cheap ones if things had gone to plan.

Wheel centre caps - I thought I'd simply push the caps out of the old wheels and put them on the new wheels each time I swapped them. Tesla claim they don't come out easily and you need another set. I'm rather unconvinced, but I was under duress at the time. I'll maybe try taking one out of the spares when I get a moment.

Tyres - not had much chance to really try them out yet, but immediate impression on the drive home from the service centre was that they seemed quieter than the Goodyears that I had on this morning. Wh/mile was slightly better on the way home than on the way out, but it's not really comparable - outbound was mostly dual carriageway in the dry and no traffic, return was mostly slower back roads avoiding traffic but pissing with rain.",9.0,0,1031

""Can this be the new way we identify a malfunctioning supercharger stall??
It is painful watching so many drivers continue to try to use the one that’s not working, and sometimes losing their place in line... ""

I agreed and said I'd spread the word...

However, STEP 1 is to call and work with Tesla Supercharger to make sure that the stall is out of service, so call for help, then if Tesla says it's bad, do this... (Phone number is usually on the supercharger head unit, if not email - [email protected] )

STEP 2 will then be to do this...

Malfunction Supercharger Sign.jpg by Dennis Pascual, on Flickr

I like this because it's clean, keeps the cable off the ground and away from any further physical damage and obvious.

Like I said, first VERIFY with Tesla that a stall is misbehaving before doing this to the stall.

As for when to put it up, I would say when the charger is really bad (inoperative or severely disabled), if it's lower than expected, that can be heat, or splitting.

465,Financial justification for NEW model S in own company pre 2021,27081,"Nov 20, 2018","So having looked at financial modelling for a used Tesla, and been for a test drive (oops, sorry, experience) the sales lady thought I should look at new, as I can write off the cost against a year of profits (hopefully they'll exceed £80k!).

Now if I loaned the company £80k to buy the car and took repayments over three years (so £2,428/month which includes interest at 3%) how would that pan out?

I'm no accountant, but this is my best guess at the workings!

I'd presumably be incurring BIK of 16% * £80k * whatever my tax rate is - so maybe £5,120/annum for me to pay in tax (and a bit more tax on the interest).

But the company would save maybe £16k of corporation tax.

The effective cost to the company in year 1 would therefore be £2,428 * 12 - £16k = £13,139 or £1,094/month. That could be deducted from my dividends/salary. 

Assuming still at the 40% rate, that means I would lose £656/month in year 1 in addition to the £426/month of BIK although I'd be earning a little bit of interest (maybe £20/month after tax)

So adding BIK tax and drop in net salary, being the owner of a new car would cost me about £1,100 per month in year 1. That's quite a lot...

However, when BIK drops to 2%, that would be £700/month.

After 3 years, the car would be paid off (and belong to the company) and I guess I could continue to enjoy it for just the BIK factor of whatever that will be then. Doubt it'll be as little as the 2%, somehow.

467,Estimating pack degradation,49241,"Jan 19, 2018","Tesla don't give us a measure of battery degradation, unlike LEAF which has battery bars.

LeafSpy will give us a very precise (distinct from ""accurate"" as the BMS can be fooled) number for battery health.

I believe TM-Spy can do the same for Teslas - but this is a bit more difficult to use than Leafspy, requiring a piece of trim to be removed and a special cable which I am not (yet) in possession of.

In the absence of TM-Spy, I think there are 2 ways we can estimate pack health.

1 is the displayed mileage available. I am very unsure of whether this actually declines as the battery degrades, whether Tesla have changed the ""100%"" number with firmware upgrades over time, whether US and European cars have comparable numbers, whether or not the displayed numbers are affected GOM-style by driving style, etc. Comments appreciated.

There are threads on TMC where people - mostly American - post their 90% or 100% numbers. FWIW my MS 70, with a 70 pack (p/n 1055893-00-C) has either 278 or 219 miles available at 99% charge, depending on whether the ""laughable Goebbels-esque lie"" (""ideal"") mode or ""just optimistic"" (""rated"") mode is selected.


2 is the ""charge energy added"" value which is available from the API that the phone app uses. Although this value doesn't seem to be exposed by the phone app, it's available from the API.

It's not documented at Tesla Model S JSON API · Apiary but the charge_state call returns it as ""charge_energy_added"" with a value in kWh representing the amount of energy added to the battery by the last charge. [Seemingly about 5-10% less than the metered power I consume to add - pleasingly efficient and better than the LEAF managed]

By looking at the number of ""charge energy added"" kWh required to advance the battery percentage we can calculate what the available pack capacity is and compare this to the capacity available when new - summarised from wk057's TMC posts at Tesla’s hacked Battery Management System exposes the real usable capacity of its battery packs

The 70 pack had 68.8kWh available when new, net of anti-bricking buffer etc.

Charging mine from 5% to 99% gave a reported 63.7kWh increase.

Note that there's some uncertainty around these as ""5"" could be ""4.500000009""% or ""5.4999999""% etc, and also that all numbers from the BMS are estimates and the state of batteries/cells varies with time, temperature, discharge rate, etc. We're dealing with approximations and should be wary of excess precision.

The Bjorn Nyland video which Simon Mac posted earlier also notes that a brand new Tesla with a brand new pack will charge *past* 100% - it continues charging after ""100%"" and the first bit of driving results in no drop in range until we get back down from "">100%"" to ""100%"". I haven't observed this but it would suggest a greater degree of degradation than I calculate here, if it applies to all packs.

Anyway, that's 94 percentage points increase, +/- 2.

63.7/.94 = 67.8kWh 0-100% - ie 1 kWh down from the ""new"" value of 68.8kWh.

471,Used Model S as company car... Looking at the numbers,27081,"Nov 10, 2018","I'm coming to the end of the lease on my ICE and considering going electric. I think it would have to be a plugin or a long range (250 miles+) BEV. 

One thing I have, that could be useful, is my own company, so doing it as a company car seems logical.

Timing seems to be key. BIK rates are SO strange - ramping up to 16% before dropping down to 2% for BEV - and then it's a mystery, but one would expect they will start creeping up. I'll assume this arrangement starts in 2020.

One idea that seems attractive is buying a used Model S (actually, I think Model 3 would be too small for me) and then giving it to myself as a company car. I could lend the company the money for this.

The figures could be something like:
- Buy Model S for about £40k - the list price would have been about £80k? Maybe less?
- Assuming I'm paying higher rate tax (most of my remuneration is currently in dividends, but I think the income tax is still the same) then it will cost me £80k * 2% * 40% = £640/year in tax
- Then if this loan to the company has an interest rate of 5% then they'd be paying me £2000/year, but that would be subject to income tax itself, so I'd get £1,200 - so I guess that means that I'm being paid about £560/year to finance and have the car. Although if I'd kept my £40k, it could maybe earn me 2%, £800/year. Maybe I'll just ignore these figures and say that the interest payments cancel out the BIK.
- Cost to the company would be the £2000/year + the loan repayments - say £10,000/year = £12,000/year (this would fall as the loan is paid off).
- That £12,000 can be deducted from my salary pre-tax, so that would cost me £7,200/year. 
- After 4 years, the car is fully paid off and belongs to the company - who could continue to let me have it for just the BIK figure (or sell it to upgrade)

Does that all sound about right?

- I've excluded serving and ""fuel"" here, but servicing costs can presumably be paid by the company pre-tax. Would servicing costs paid by the company also be VAT-recoverable?

I guess the alternative is to lease something (can one lease used Teslas?) and then I think half the VAT can be reclaimed as well.",39.0,0,3534

495,Fuel cost estimate after 12 months with a Model S,3849,"Jan 16, 2017","I just ran some estimates off my records for my first year of running a Model S just for my interest, but it struck me they might be useful for prospective owners so here goes;

Total mileage was 29,200 miles for the 12 months (more than originally planned due to a charge of job role)
Total power usage (from car trip) 9,351 kWh

Total charge from home charger 4,845 kWh at an estimated 95% efficiency (note I need to measure this more accurately at some time).
Total cost of electricity £332 (split approx 95% on E7, rest on day rate)

Total charge at work 684 kWh at a cost of £6.84 (I pay 10p/kWh to cover charging efficiency, bulk cost 8.9p/kWh)

My total fuel cost for the year was therefore £339 or 1.16p/mile

If I'd had to pay for the rapid charges then this is how it works out;

Total Supercharger use approx 3,491 kWh which would have been around £700
Total EH rapid use 18 charges yielding 330 kWh at a cost of £108 (I'm an Ecotricity customer so these came at no extra cost)

Total fuel cost if paying for rapid charging would have worked out at about £1,150 for the year or 3.9 p/mile
With my Prius the total fuel cost would have come in at about £2,450 or 8.4 p/mile
To get a lower fuel cost than the Model S with all the electricity charges included I would have needed a car capable of something like 140 MPG.",32.0,5,3918

A bit of an unusual occurrence yesterday. I was at Warwick SB supercharger, along with a Model X and a red Model S 60.

I'm fiddling around in the back of my car sorting stuff out, and I see the occupants of the Model S (an ""older"" couple) walking away from their car into the services. Nothing unusual - then I spot they've left their drivers door wide open.

I shout but they're too far away and disappear into the services. 

The Model X pulls away, so I can't ask him to keep a watch on the open car while I go and find the owner.

I go and look in the open Model S, and find they've left their bags, purse and other stuff on display.

Not wanting to leave the car, I waited about 30 mins whilst my car charged, then another 10 for them to come back. Their car had finished charging a while before. No sign of them whatsoever (hello overstay fees!).

So I decided that I should close their door but leave a note in the windscreen, telling them they left the door wide open, and with the phone number on which to call Tesla should they have left their key fob in the car, so they can remotely unlock it. I even switch off the air con so the paper wouldn't blow away. 

Very strange!

I started getting the low key fob battery warning about 2 weeks into owning my model X (I mean the wife's model x) I ordered some new batteries and after reading a few things on line splashed out on the same Panasonic cells that were in the fobs. Good date (2028)and look genuine. 

Replaced both of them. Still got the message so I swapped them again (I ordered 5!). Now one of my fobs doesn't work at all. Pushing the buttons doesn't do anything. If I hide the good one the car doesn't recognise the bad one, even in the car. The other one is fine but still get the low battery warning on the dash. 

I phoned tesla and they were going to send round somebody to programme a new key, but then she phoned me back to tell me that the fobs were out of stock. She's posting me some new batteries but I'm not hopeful.

Any ideas of weird and wonderful things I can try in the mean time?

I don't have any issues spending money on the car, but I also don't like throwing money away for no reason at all.

The only consumable item included is key fob battery (£1 a pair), so £599 is been spent doing a multipoint inspection, the service centre labour rates are £150/hr and I find it a little hard to believe a service tech is going to spend 4hrs 'inspecting' a car which neither the owner nor on-board diagnostics is reporting a fault?

Here’s how you can help and get a chance to win the Model 3 for as little as $10.

Kimbal owns The Kitchen, a chain of restaurants located across the American Heartland.

Through his experience in the restaurant business, he has been promoting “real food” and he co-founded a non-profit called Big Green, which has already built hundreds of outdoor “Learning Gardens” in schoolyards to familiarize children with where food comes from.

The campaign will be running until the end of April at which point they will hold the drawing and give away the vehicle.

Theres a few YouTube videos on how to add the HEPA filter as DIY to non-preimum cars, so I ordered a custom made HEPA filter with the same measurements as the Tesla HEPA filter holder a while back. Had some free time today so finally got round to fitting it.

It really was quite easy, there was a considerable amount of debris/dirt in the empty HEPA filer holder when I opened it up, so will be interesting to see just how much thats reduced by the addition of the filter.

This is the filter I bought, £120 for 2 including delivery and tax from US - Tesla I believe will sell you just the filter+filter holder for £100ish.










Front of the X with the frunk removed, really easy job, just a pain with the x12 nuts that needs to be undone.









Filter fitted to the cars empty filter holder.









Filter back in place, I will open it up and check again in about 10K.









Some random thoughts on working on the X

1: Not having to worry about oil/water lines/engine in the 'bonnet' area is amazing, the amount of extra space to fiddle makes things really easy, I recon removing the whole headlight assembly would be a 10-15 minute job compared to nearly 1hr in my old BMW.

2: Snap in clips used by Tesla are far sturdier than used by BMW/Lexus/Nissan. I've worked on my previous 350Z/335i/wife Lexus, and in nearly all case when opening trim/plastic cover breaking a clip/tie is easily done, but on the X it was much easier and everything just snaps in/out with no fuss.

3: I watched a bit of Rich Rebulds on YouTube and up until now I didn't believe him when he claims he had never worked on a salvage car before Teslas, and that these cars are really easy to rebuild. But now I believe him. Once our X is out of warranty I cannot wait to try some crazy mods - a DIY install of a 100kWh pack battery would be at the top of the list . Though people are worried about owning Teslas out of warranty, once third party suppers start supporting parts working on these machines will become DIY jobs.






Next job for me probably audio upgrade. Thinking about paying someone add a woofer but now that I've had a play with things I think I might give it ago. On my BMW it took me pretty much all day, think on the X it will be much quicker, just need to do some research first.",9.0,1,2451

Last few day I've driven Leicester to Leeds twice, not only did I not bother using any Supercharging (despite there been various options), once in Leeds I had enough range spare to carry 4 adults + 2 kids to the RHS flower show in Harrogate.

Intotal I've probably spent 12hrs+ behind the wheel last few days (No AutoPilot use at all), and all I could think about last night when parking up was where to drive to today - London/Cardiff are the two options.

I even bothered to give the interior of the car a clean, since the 10K mark is coming up. For all those who are obessed with poor build quality, sorry to disappoint you but the interior of X is looking in better shape than our Lexus. Can you tell this white leather seat has been occupied by a toddler seat for the best of 10K?? I cannot, and the driver seat looks just the same - as new.

Despite the 12hr+ I spent on the A1/M1 last few days the only other EVs I saw on the roads were 4 other Teslas, the majority of the public still dont seem to be ready for these cars. Even yesterday I had a parent at nursery tell me they thought about getting a X to replace their XC90 but when they really thought about it they just couldnt live with a car that didn't have a 500 mile range and it would be such a hassel plug-in every night. Day before whilst I was waiting for my wife to finish some shopping, a delivery van driver knocked on my window as he wanted to let me know he thought he could the hear the aircon on from the outside and was worried I would drain the battery down!!

I use to try and convince/correct some of these ideas but after 3.5 years of listening to the same 'concerns' about EVs I just cannot be bothered anymore, I just nod and smile these days.....after all someone still need to pay for fuel duty/road tax .

So Leicester to London or Cardiff today?? Still dont know, and actually I don't care, I just need an excuse to go out for a drive. When I became a dad and life forced priorities such as carrying grandparents/saftey/cargo space to the top of the car shopping list, I honestly thought the days I would enjoy driving was gone.

I imagine the decision making piece must be just us complex as the recognition piece so if they can’t utilise AI (I.e. their data set advantages of having a massive existing fleet) then I don’t see how they can possibly catch Waymo - who are already taking the volunteering public around Phoenix with an engineer in the back, I.e. they have already solved driver policy, at least within a geofenced region.

541,Disappointed with Tesla' Policy Change,38937,"May 31, 2018","So my car is in the SC tomorrow to get the Air Suspension looked at, as well as an issue with the ambient lighting inside after been booked in for a few weeks in advanced.

I've been told the day before that they have a new EU/UK policy on their Tesla Loaners that they now only provide 3rd party insurance and customers must provide their own if they want to have comp cover.

Now, while contracts say the courtesy car is a courtesy and not part of the agreement, one reason I went with Tesla and the service contract was for the experience, to be looked after like someone who owns a premium car should be, the 'premium level of service'. To have this taken away is a kick in the teeth especially if the car becomes a regular feature at an SC. Due to my age, temp comp insurance is expensive and £90 per day on a Model S so now every time there is an issue, I have to pay £90 a day to use a replacement for my expensive car.

This has really soured Tesla in my eyes on what has mostly been a wonderful experience. I've been with Porsche and other premium dealers before and they always treat their loyal customers well.

Tesla said Model 3 production hit 2,270/week in April. The company had earlier warned that it would miss the weekly production target of 2,500 Model 3s in Q1 and 5,000 Model 3s in Q2. Deliveries were impacted by two production delays during the quarter caused by “problems relating to excessive automation.”
Meanwhile, the company once again maintained its optimism of achieving its weekly production target of 5,000 Model 3s in the coming two months. Tesla also reiterated its long-term gross margin target of 25% for Model 3.

Surely its just a matter of time before some one kills themselves again because the software still is too dumb to work out the difference between a stationary obstruction on the road and scenery.

Am just staggered people still use AP knowing how stupid the system is??

The claims about AP been 'safer' than a human driver is also BS. AP is mainly used on M-ways/highways, most road death are are on small single carriageways. Per mile travelled M-ways/highways are already the safest roads in any country, conversly AP will cause a hell alot of accidents on A/B roads if used in signficant numbers.

Out of all the things that threaten Tesla I personally think the inability of Tesla to deliver on AP maybe the biggest threat to their survival.

Musk has already started to back track on FSD, but its too late I fear, the claim all AP 2.0+ have the hardware needed for FSD is one massive litigation time bomb that may just sink Tesla .

556,Tesla pricing - any haggle room?,8443,"May 5, 2018","Hi,

Current Tesla Virgin here. 

I've got a reservation on a model 3 which at the moment is due about the time my i3 lease runs out (May 19).

Tesla rang me up last week asking me if I wanted to drive a model s or model X. I guess they probably thought I was waiting for my model 3. It got me thinking about an s or x to replace my wife's current diesel MPV. Hopefully we'll drive an s this coming Friday, maybe an x as well.

My question is, is there any haggle room for the cash purchase price or lease price or is the price on the Web site the price you pay? I managed to wangle a good deal on my i3 but something tells me that Teslas won't be like this.

Any advice welcome.

559,Changes in motor efficiency?,2143,"May 5, 2018","So today was the first time we've had consistent double digit temp and I had chance to do a decent back to back M-way in our July 2017 build X. Speed was 55-65mph, outside temp around 21, air-con on for both trips. I was amazed to see as I parked up an total consumption of 3.6 miles per kWh for the whole day!!!

If your use to a Leaf/Ionqi that number will see awful but I never saw a total trip consumption of under 330Wh/mile in our old 60D X or the 90D X loaner I had last summer. 

There is some noise Tesla 'updated' the S/X motors around July 2017, I need to do some more long runs, but our current July 2017 X was returning consumption figures I've never seen in any X I've driven before. 

Has anyone else with a late July 2017 build S/X noticed difference in consumption compared to older cars??



















Compare that to my old Leaf, driven at a slower speed, no air con, which after a 88 mile run into London (including a charging stop) was showing 91 miles a 100% charge, which given 21kWh usable = 4.3 miles per kWh. Given the massive size/performance difference of the X to the Leaf, I'm amazed how efficient it is...more runs are needed to confirm though, however am not complaining .

570,External WiFi for my spoilt Tesla ...,675,"Apr 13, 2018","So, apparently Telsa prioritises pushing new firmware downloads to cars that are on WiFi rather than just relying on the car's in-built 3G mobile data. Well I checked my MS and it does see the house's wifi but only barely. I thought I would improve this, did a bit of research and head scratching, and invested in a Wavlink AC600 High Power Dual Band Outdoor WiFi Range Extender (see wavlink for product details). 

After some more head scratching, I invested in some more fittings and waterproof enclosures, ran a 10m CAT6 cable from a socket in my lean-to shed and completed the installation yesterday. Total cost was about £60, as I had to replace a two-ganged socket in the lean-to with something a bit less medieval! As always the work conformed to the three basic and enduring rules of DIY:

I ended up using pretty much every single blasted tool I own.
It took three times longer than I thought it would.
And I ended up bleeding.
But victory was mine in the end and I am no getting an excellent signal just outside my garage. Note that I am currently using it in WiFi repeater mode, where it wirelessly picks up my home router's wifi signal and acts as a new wifi access point (AP), so the only use of the CAT6 cable is for power (POE - Power Over Ethernet). If this doesn't work reliably, I'll stick a powerline adapter in the lean-to, and connect that to the AC600. This will effectively be a wired connection to the router, but via the mains cabling.

Anyway, bla, bla, bla ... here are some pictures of the install and the resulting signal strength:










Above: The AC600 on it's cranked pole to avoid the eves.









Above: The connector inside a waterproof enclosure. It provides power (PoE) and also can connect a wired LAN connection.










And, hey presto, from weak-and-feeble signal strength to EXCELLENT! 

Hope this is useful for any other Tesla owners out there who might want to boost their car's connectivity and get firmware updates in a more timely fashion. Plus, when summer eventually condescends to show up I can surf the web outside now!

Thought it might be helpful to others looking to fix/repair their HomeLink, or even make it working from the start, like myself.

I have been trying to set it up since the beginning to no avail. I have a key fob, which works just no problem, opening and closing, but when I tried to teach a car to use it, nothing worked. The HomeLink wizard originally asks to push the button on the fob, then when it learns it, it is asking to press ""learn"" button on the HomeLink device itself. No matter how many times I tried all - nothing worked.

But solution was really very simple, I had to change Transmit Mode from ""Standard"" to ""Universal"", the only problem was to find this very well hidden link, which didn't even look like a link, not mentioned in any manual, and I failed to find any info about it in the multiple Tesla forums I searched. Now on the screenshot it coloured blue, but before I used it, it was same grey as text above making it very hard to notice. 

After I changed it to Universal, the wizard didn't need the fob and worked directly with device.

If someone made a cable with 2 bs1363 plugs on one end, paralleled up and presented on a 32A commando, could they then charge at (say) 20A? Obviously the reduced current would have to be selected before it was connected, or it would blow fuses and/or trip breakers pretty quickly. Temperatures of sockets would have to be monitored carefully - using 10A on each half of a double bs1363 outlet is probably not good for 12 hours.

There are a number of dangers here, including that of overloading the ring serving the sockets, of connecting two rings together *via* the two bs1363 plugs, and of only a single plug being connected, the other dangling and with 240V across it...

Another alternative might be to present two different bs1363 plugs as 2 ""phases"" on the red 16A 3-phase commando plug - would that work if the 2 phases weren't actually offset?",27.0,0,3779

That's not surprising, and I expect they may well achieve that aim.

BUT... on the actual call Elon went hugely further and said that

they could have done it already on a special case basis (i.e. training the system to know one particular route and then running it a few times until it got it right) but that would have been a waste of time and effort
when they do it they will do it with the proper FSD feature that won't have been specially trained on this route
he expects this real FSD feature to be not only demonstrated but also released to customers' cars within the next three to six months
I mean, really? Does he even slightly believe this? Is he so far down the rabbit hole that he thinks this is plausible?! Are the comments of the CEO and largest shareholder during a Shareholder conference call just to be considered 'mere puffery' with no obligation being created on the company to ensure that these are reasonable and plausible?

I mean I'd love it to be true (my car has FSD enabled) but I just can't get my head around that.

NB he has also said that in his view once the FSD feature arrives then the current pricing ($3000) looks too low and that around $5000 is more likely. Can he really be saying this stuff just to try to get more people to buy FSD in the next few months?",72.0,2,4814

611,Test drive first impressions.. undecided on S or X,51681,"Jan 21, 2018","I've been researching Teslas for a while and took the plunge of going for a Test drive of both S and X.

First drove a blue 90D, black interior. Was very impressed. I'm used to driving a hybrid SUV, so being low down took a little getting used to. Handling was great, quality of interior was better than I expected and 'luxury' enough in my opinion.
Tried out autopilot which was very strange, but in a good way! I'm sure I could get used to it.
Acceleration and performance was ample and instantaneous, I personally can't see the need for a P model unless you go drag racing.
Rear Seats - I really don't like the older rear seats that the car had. This puts me off the new inventory cars as none of them appear to have the contoured seats. The showroom S had the new seats like this photo: https://teslamotorsclub.com/tmc/attachments/img_20170913_190136-jpg.248169/

Then took a 6-seater X for a spin. 
Size - My worry with the X was always that it was too big and narrow streets would be a problem. To my surprise it wasn't and the sensors help guide you down any narrow gaps. Placing the car in the road was fine.
Seat position is more like what I'm used to and it felt great. the 3rd row seats did not give much legroom, so I would go for a 5-seater (also so that the 2nd row can fold flat)
Rear doors - amazing technology but I can't help feeling there's a lot more to go wrong in the long term. I guess not a worry during warranty.
Black textile seats are very good. Might go with that as a lower cost option.

So I'm undecided.. both are great cars. The X offers better comfort for the family but the S is more sporty.

There are some 'new inventory' S 100Ds with ~10k miles that are arguably better value especially as there's a lower interest rate on 90 and 100 cars but I can't bear the bench rear seat.

Well it looks like Wk057 over on TMC is nearly to publish his data on degredation of the 75/90 packs which uses different chemistry to the old 85 and current 100.

`I have information that shows definitively that the early 75 and 90 packs degrade much more quickly than the original 60 (not software limited packs), 85, and 70 (not software limited) packs.`

'90 pack owners having less rated range than their 85 counterparts before 50,000 miles'

It also probably explains the appearance of older 85 packs in some European 75 cars earlier this year, as Tesla has apparently changed the current 75 pack chemistry to be the same as the 100. The 85 must have been used to bridge any shortfalls in production of the newer 75 packs.

Will be fascinating to see what data he comes out with, but it shows how close to the limit we are with current lithium ion chemistry, as the 'newer' 75/90 battery packs is inferior tech compared to the older 85 packs.

It also pretty much confirms the Roadester 2.0 MUST be using a different batter setup......also raises the question of Model 3 pack chemistry as clearly newer doesnt not equal better in the world of Tesla battery tech!!! I wonder if the drive to use less expensive raw materials is the cause for some of this worse degradation.

Teslas reaction to this info will be interesting as Musk has on numerous occasions 'Thanked' current S/X owners for buying the cars depsite the high price/new tech......Will he/Tesla follow through with actions by offerng 75/90 owners a solution?

However, the uncertainty over Tesla’s future, together with a complete drive train failure proved enough of a kick to get my eye wandering.

We drove 130+ miles to Milton Keynes yesterday to collect our CPO Tesla, this is after making a special trip back from Europe to collect said car.
We arrived a little early and were informed they were running late so thought fair enough and came back at the new agreed time. The car was still no where to be seen, hoping to get a sneak view before the handover.
We started to go through the paperwork for the one third finance. Everything seemed fine until I read the small print, apparently Black Horse have a clause so you have to inform them if you wish to take the car out of the UK. I pointed this out and said as Tesla are well aware we spend a lot of time in Europe, they would contact Black Horse who said no the car cannot leave the UK.
Now the issue here is I had never seen this paperwork before or I would have brought it up at an earlier date. Now checking My Tesla Account, this paperwork was uploaded only a few days ago, all after the last email from Tesla verifying the collection date and time. If I had seen this paperwork earlier then I would have simply got a bank loan for the difference (at a lower interest rate).
I have never had finance on anything before so I had no idea of how it works.
So we have now spent quite a lot of money on the ferry, fuel etc etc as well as a lot of time wasted and still have no Tesla.

The drawings shown on the planning application look the same as Cambourne's first site in Somerset, albeit it with 3 sets of batteries and inverters.

Open Energi and Camborne Energy Storage take Tesla battery into frequency response market | theenergyst.com

If Tesla could tie up in this way with green energy investors looking to do grid balancing, who then base a business plan on using rate arbitrage as the means to fund the DNO's costs to pull in 11kV lines, then this could take some of the investment pressure off Tesla themselves.

648,How to purchase a Tesla Model X,20489,"Oct 27, 2017","Hi All,

I went on a test drive of a Tesla Model X at Bluewater and have totally fallen in love (I knew I would). I currently drive a Renault Zoe and it has been a wonderful introduction to the world of EVs. Having 2 young children, I can’t think of a car that is better than the X and I literally NEED it! LOL

My wife and I run a Ltd Co and I am contemplating purchasing through the business .... does this make sense - I’ll add some figures below so that you can get an idea of what we are working with.

Our Ltd Co has made £50k profit a year (we have been running for 2 years) for the past two years and we are set to be at this level, for our current 3rd year (if not a little higher).

For the 17/18 Tax year we will get paid to the Personal Allowance level and take minimal dividends having an income of about £18k each. Over the previous year we took more money so we could get a mortgage that all went through a few weeks ago - hence why profits will be higher this year. 

The Model X that I want is around £75k  but wanted to know what you think is the best finance option for us, personally or through the Ltd Co - I will of course get advice from our accountant, but if anyone on here who has any experience I would be really grateful.

I have about £20k in the company and I could use about £8k for a deposit on the car.
I will be driving about 25k miles a year.
I want to purchase before the end of the year to get the free supercharging.",34.0,0,5583

It is behind a paywall so I can't link it but its basically arguing that a small cheap ICE car does less ""lifecycle"" damage than a Tesla Model S, this calculation pretty much entirely hinges on two things :

the much higher production emissions of the Tesla vs the chosen comparator, a Mitsubishi Mirage (12204 kg Co2 vs 4752 kg Co2)
an assumed HC portion of electricity generated
Looking at some of the source data at Carboncounter | Cars evaluated against climate targets it doesn't seem to marry up very well, leading me to think its a bit of a biased view (er, very actually).

It also quotes Peter Mock, EU MD of the International Centre for Clean Transport, on how Tesla have driven manufacturers to build cars with batteries which are ""too big"" and that ""bigger batteries could damage the green credentials of electric vehicles.... ....procuring metals such as cobalt, 60 per cent of which comes from the Democratic Republic of Congo"".

Peter obviously lives nice and close to his office and doesn't drive far 

I'll leave the politicians to fight it out, we bought our MS because it is an awesome car - in 15 years when everyone's stopped fighting I'll probably know whether it was environmentally friendly or not.

The 'since last charge' figures say the following. Miles 152, kWh 53.1, average kWh/mile 351. Which is fine, until you know that I only have 15 miles of range left!! So if that 15 miles equates to about 6% battery, it means that my 90% battery will be about 57.5kWh?

665,Is this a reasonable way to work out battery capacity?,3331,"Oct 11, 2017","I have been working out the battery capacity of my cars using the following method. Is this valid?

When I know I am going to drive a day trip that will require me to charge before I get home, (or I know I will get home with less than 20%), I charge to 100%. I do it this way because any overnight phantom drain is eliminated.

Just before I charge I take note, (well take a picture really), of the percentage, (x), the battery is at this point and how many kiloWatts, (P), have been used. I'm usually around 10-20% at this time.

I then say P/(100-x)*100 gives me my total battery capacity.

With my ""old"" Model S 85, that had done 40,000+ miles, I was getting between 69-70kWhr as the capacity. I was only measuring this late on in its life.

With my Model X 90D, 2000 miles, I'm getting 78-80kWhr. This is only over 4 trips but its pretty consistent. 2 of those trips were towing the caravan but I don't think that should affect battery capacity.

666,Full Self Driving....,5455,"Oct 10, 2017","I just wanted to flag this recent article on the electrek website:

Over 35,000 Tesla owners bought ‘fully self-driving’ feature despite still being unavailable

It points out that of the approximately 90k Model S and X cars sold with AP2 hardware, 77% of owners bought the 'enhanced' Autopilot and around 40% paid for the 'full self driving' upgrade that doesnt even exist.

Personally Im surprised both numbers are so high. Even now, 12 months after its release AP2 is still arguably worse than AP1 and development efforts have clearly been diverted to the Model 3 - with AP2 not having been substantively updated for some time. Meanwhile full self driving efforts have similarly gone quiet and many owners are likely to end up handing back PCP leases with the option never even activated....

Obviously, selling vapourware to well off, keen early-adopters is easy money. But its not exactly professional and doesnt exactly inspire confidence.....

Speaking from my own personal experience running a biomedical research lab, one of the key aspects of supervising the truly gifted PhD students is to keep them focussed on their primary project.

669,Visited a local Tesla Showroom today....and learned a few things,971,"Sep 27, 2017","So passing the Tesla Showroom in West Drayton today, I popped in on spec with my i3 to chat about the incoming choice in 2019/20 of New long range model 3 vs 2nd hand 2016/17 Model S.

Although neither I of the salesguy knew the UK model 3 prices we agreed to just convert $ USD to $GBP for the sake of the discussion.

So at least £40k for a long range Model 3 vs 2nd hand Model S with 300 mile range. We looked at the 2nd hand 2014 S85 for £42k as a guide for a 3 year old model.

Two things I learned I never knew, and both impressed me. If you buy a 2nd hand Tesla from Tesla, you get the balance of the cars lifetime battery warranty, and a fresh Tesla warranty, but you can either opt for 4 years and 50k miles or two years and 100k miles.

I also learned that if you buy any Tesla, outright or via HP / Loan, you don't have to service it to still be covered by any Tesla warranties. Servicing is only mandatory on PCP Teslas, I assume to help keep the GFV.

So as someone doing 25-30k miles a year these two options add a different twist to buying a approved used 2nd hand Model S from Tesla in 2019/20 rather than a new Model 3.

But in wondered, if in say 2019 I bought a 2017 S100 with 40k miles on it for say £45k, did 60k miles in it over 2 years under warranty, what would the value of a 3rd hand S100 with 100k miles and no warranty be? And do Tesla take 3rd hand high mileage Model S in PX for another 2nd Hand Model S or new Model 3 / Model Y ?

This is hard as you just don't see and 2nd hand Model S for sale under £40k and older than 2014 in the UK. I assumed it only arrived in RHD in 2014? Even Model S with 70k+ miles are selling for over £40k.

Some fascinating insight into the Model S drive train too. It seems that even on these short dyno pulls the firmware in the inverter/motor is throttling back power due to heat build up. 

Also impressive is that the Volt batteries are capable of running the motor at full power, with less voltage sag than a comparable Tesla pack. (of course capacity is lower, so no such thing as a free lunch), Range is yet to be seen, but with 2 sets of Volt salvaged batteries it should be reasonable.

They claim it is only 200lbs heavier than the Evora, but with twice the wheel horse power (and over a much broader range). So if they can crack sustained power it should be one very quick track car! 

Will be really interesting to see the finished article, and I'm sure this will peel back more of the technical details of the Tesla drive train. One in particular we can already see is that the motor, originally out of an S85, is being driven right up to P85 levels, so it would seem the difference is primarily firmware.",11.0,3,2002

Are these using two phases or is their local supply run at 240V with a 2:1 step down transformer in every house ??

As it happens I've currently got a P85D Model S on the drive as our 60D X is having some work done. Love 'Insane' mode but will be so glad to get our X back, the rear passenger space in the S is simply tiny compared to the X, I cannot quite believe we originally ordered a S knowing small children was going to be part of lives for the foreseeable future .

Our daughters child seat simply doesn't fit!!! It's the same seat that was fine in the Leaf, wifes Lexus IS both of which is smaller than the S. Since picking up the X we been ferrying around grandparents + baby every weekend in comfort, cannot even imagine trying to squeeze two kid seats in the back of a S let alone two adults + baby seat .

Working on the basis the 3 will have less interior space than the S, all of a sudden I've lost all interest in it, add in no powered doors, no instrument panel, its going to feel very low rent compared to our X.

BUT interesting to hear Musk now starting to drop more hints on the Y, and suggesting itll be a true 'nexy gen' EV rather than a cheap Model S which the 3 will be.

Ofcourse we all know Elon likes to exaggerate, but I cannot disagree with him on the fact the X been 'the best SUV ever, and better SUV than the Model S is a sedan...""

After that I set the charge limit to 80% and was getting 226 miles at most when fully charged at 80%.

As the months passed and the temperature dropped, this started dropping by a couple of miles every so often. I thought it probably had something to do with the lower temperature.

Fast forward to today, having covered 21k miles since August last year (of which 95% are motorway miles), I charged the car at home overnight and the reading is showing 214 miles at 80% charge. I recently charged at a SC a couple of times to 100% (having got there with approx 50-60 miles capacity remaining) and at full charge the reading was 260 miles.

FYI, initially I would only use superchargers but only charged to 80%. This lasted a couple months but then I started charging at home and work with maybe one charge every 2 weeks at a SC. (2 phase at home and 3 phase power supply at work.) 

Other than where I have said I charged to 100%, the charge limit has remained at 80%.

The car goes into Tesla WD near the end of the month and this is one of the things I've mention to the service desk. They will hopefully investigate. Are they likely to be as concerned as me and will attempt to fix the issue? Or will they take the opposite approach?

Range mode was on in both cars, and climate control set to auto with interior temp 19, P85 was on 21 inch alloys, X on 20 inch.

The P85D returned 257Wh/mile (3.9 miles per kWh),










The 60D X returned 266Wh/mile (3.75 miles per kWh)










From memory the LEAF over the same road works returned about 4.5 miles per kWh.

So at lower speeds the X is not to dissimilar to the dual motor 'P' S on larger wheels, but clearly I can see how a 'P' X on larger wheels will gobble up electrons quicker than my daughter a pint of milk before bed time!!!

Interestingly the main instrument cluster on my X seems higher resolution than the pre-facelift S (you can see a difference in the size of screen text), the touch screen also seems more responsive on my car. So Tesla clearly are making continuous hardware improvements.",8.0,0,1040

Of the options out there the Powerwall 2 is by far the best value per kWh - with some options quite amazingly complex and delivering only a handful of kWh storage.

Rough back of an envelope numbers suggest a saving of up to £2 per day or around £700 per year giving a theoretical 10year payback.

However, despite being approved / trained Tesla power product installers they have been given almost no technical information, no insight into the control software and are just guessing about how it will integrate / communicate with the PV system.

I appreciate that this is frequently 'the Tesla way', but It just seems rather ludicrous to be promoting and taking deposits for something so vague and undefined !

So having said that... does anyone on here have any other, possibly first hand, insights ? The physical bit is just a box full of batteries, but it's the software that interests me.

when I got my first service done on my Model S (late at 16,500 miles rather than 12,000), I had to wait well over a month for a booking and my car ended up in the service centre for 6 days - I think due to them being overloaded with pre-delivery inspections. They gave me a high spec Mercedes E Class as a loan car and paid for the fuel so I couldn't really complain, but it seemed a bit inefficient.

Anyway, I've just had my second service done (also late - 35,500 miles instead of 24,000!) and this time booking in was just a few days ahead and despite it being a major service it was done in the day. I also had a fully spammed up P85D as a loan car.

I'm taking this as a good sign that with the recent expansion of service centres and personnel in the UK, they're getting a handle on the service side. The bears would no doubt say that sales must be going down, but the service centre was rammed with Model S and X's so I really doubt that.

Incidentally - the same doomsayer bears say the Model S is poor quality, old and so unreliable that owners are shedding them in large quantities. All I can say is that compared to other high end cars I've driven recently the Model S is streets ahead in so many ways and since it keeps getting software updates it's constantly improving which makes everything else seem very archaic (I like to say 20th century), and as far as reliability goes mine has been close to faultless - an initial audio issue that was fixed on the spot at delivery, a couple of times where the car doesn't recognise the key's inside and a few days with a sticky door handle that fixed itself have been my only problems.

Slowest-depreciating cars on sale

I think much of that can be attributed to range and infrastructure, whilst not wanting to gloss over the fact that they are very good cars.

When new, Tesla's have proven to be a more compelling prospect than many of their peers. As a used car I think it becomes even more compelling thanks to the lack of maintenance required. Correct me if I'm wrong, but I don't believe the drivetrain requires any servicing at all until perhaps 100,000 miles. Then its likely to be just transmission oil that needs changing. Quick and cheap. There's no need to worry about cam belts at 60,000 miles, not to mention all the other servicing. So it's just tyres, brakes and suspension. 

I wouldn't be surprised if people hang onto their Tesla's longer than they would an ICE. Less fear of things going wrong and less time spent in garages. In years to come, it might be five years and 60-100,000 miles for first owners.",22.0,0,2828

I appreciate that the Model X may well have cannibalised sales from the S, but I was also wondering if the market their price point puts them in might simply be saturating.

On the face of it, you might think that the well documented decrease in battery prices per kWh would allow Tesla to reduce prices - especially given their cars proportionately larger battery sizes.

https://static.nhtsa.gov/odi/inv/2016/INCLA-PE16007-7876.PDF

It doesn't tell us anything new about the crash itself, but does give quite a lot of detail about the operation of various systems on Model S (and also competing vehicles), so it makes an interesting read.

In particular, I learned things I didn't know before about what the automatic emergency braking actually does.

We've often discussed the fact that AEB is only there as an 'Oh xxxx!"" mode to apply braking at the last minute to lessen the impact of an unavoidable crash, and is normally switched on all the time, while the TACC aspect of autopilot, when enabled, aims to avoid a crash in the first place. There's also forward collision warning that gives you warnings (only) of objects approaching that you might be about to crash into, but doesn't take any action in itself due to the risk of false alarms.

It appears that there's a third mode: once the forward collision warning has given the alert, if you then apply some brake pressure it assumes you are confirming that this isn't a false alarm and will more fully apply the brakes if necessary to avoid the collision if possible.",3.0,3,1071

804,Launch mode counter...,832,"Jan 5, 2017","Hmm... so it seems Tesla have upset a number of people.

The tinkerers have discovered a recent update has put a countdown in cars with launch mode. Once this counter is reached (and sources think it could be as low as 25 launches) then the car PERMANENTLY downgrades it's output power.

Tesla's official disclaimer now reads :




""Using Launch Mode places an increased stress on the entire powertrain accelerating aging and fatigue of various components. The computer systems automatically track Launch Mode usage and continually estimate fatigue damage. Depending on how Launch Mode is used, the computer may eventually limit the available power during Launch Mode to protect the powertrain. Note that this is a common strategy also employed in other high performance cars.""

Click to expand...

What some are reporting is that even this is misleading and once the countdown is hit then power is reduced irrespective of launch mode or not. (Admittedly this could be a bug.) 

The real upset people have is this OTA update has downgraded their cars capabilities which they assumed was unlimited launches down to a finite number.

On the way there we had a number of 'incidents' the most scary of which was a sudden and unintended hard acceleration upon moving into the outside lane, followed by a fight for the steering wheel as it lurched back towards the lorry we were now overtaking at 90miles an hour with subsequent fish tailing as we regained control and slowed things down again. This, combined with other events such as dives down exit roads, very close passing of enormous lorries and a half arsed lane change where it gave up half way through and decided to straddle the lane markings just convinced us that we just can't trust autopilot. Even when we did give it other chances having a foot hovering over the brake pedal and gripping the steering wheel with white knuckles while constantly trying to second guess what it was going to do next was just too stressful. Also having to take your eyes off the traffic around you to constantly check the instrument cluster to see if it wants yet another nudge is very distracting.

We didn't even try to engage autopilot on the way back and had a smoother, faster and much more relaxing return journey where WE felt as if we were in control. Where we could anticipate overtaking manuvers, feather the throtttle to avoid harsh acceleration and gently regen down to match traffic conditions way in advance of anything that the car could have done itself.

I'm sorry, it's a clever party trick that's great to impress passengers who haven't driven in a Model S before. However in our experience, it's a jerky, unpredictable and very stressful way to travel any distance.

It's a bit of a shame as it was both an expensive option and something I have tried hard to like and learn to live with. But we'll not be using it again....",112.0,4,7672

Today we were driving around and I was trying to call up music via voice command. It was being a bit stroppy and Spotify acting up. At this point my Wife had a stroke of genius: ""Maybe Alexa could get a job at Tesla!""

TBH I don't disagree with her, as far as I'm concerned you can keep your AP2. The thing that would get me to upgrade my Model S would be a similarly impressive natural voice control.

For those of you that haven't yet tried Echo, the biggest differences / features are:
- Much better accuracy
- Broader set of commands (in Amazon parlance called skills)
- Integration with third party hardware and services (i.e Philps Hue bulbs / Uber / Just Eat / Amazon prime shopping*) 
- Natural operation, especially with the use of a ""Wake word"". So starting a sentence ""Alexa"" is equivalent to pressing the voice button on the wheel.

I've already worked out that I probably don't need anything other than my home charger plus the supercharger network within the UK. My main long distance journeys are from South Wales to Manchester and London and I reckon I can manage those fine.

Ditto visiting my parents in Scotland - they're 95 miles from the Gretna SC and I can manage by using a 13A socket and the UMC. An alternative is to buy a Chademo adapter, it seems most of the major towns I go through to get to them have CYC chargers which are currently free to use.

I'm planning to go to the F1 in Spa in August which looks more challenging. I'd really like to stay in Spa but the only Tesla destination charger there is at the Radisson Blu Hotel who seem to have no availability for the F1 weekend, presumably booked up long in advance. Alternatively the Crowne Plaza in Liege has destination chargers and we could stay there. The last supercharger is near Brussels and about 95km from Liege, 150km from Spa.

So it seems main options are:
1. Stay in Liege and use destination charger at hotel (60km from circuit)
2. Find somewhere in Spa and try to blag use of destination charger at Radisson (unlikely)
3. Find somewhere in Spa and use public chargers. Presumably would need to be Chademo to be useful.
4. Find somewhere in Spa and plug UMC into a 'normal' power outlet.

I disliked (and didn't take part in) the initial referral programme - it was too generous to the referrer, and called into question the impartiality of advice given if you stood to gain significant cash benefit.

The current scheme is better; giving only modest rewards unless you clock up a large number of referrals in the short period for which each scheme runs.

And the discount is almost justifiable - whether the code is from a personal contact or from trawling around on forums, the customer who has picked one up is better informed and likely to need less hand-holding from Tesla staff (and/or gives a higher conversion rate of prospects to sales for such effort as they do put in). Not clear that's really £750 worth, but it's certainly worth something.

OTOH, the short-duration referral schemes are all part of the mad rush for end of quarter numbers - which it would be nice to see an end of, but there seems slim chance of any change in the forseeable future.

825,Advice on upcoming trip,6904,"Dec 12, 2016","This coming weekend we will be travelling up to the Alton Towers Splash Landings Hotel for a one night stop-over and for the little one to see Santa.

In my ICE car I would be looking at 130 miles and 2 1/2 hours each way, but I would prefer to take the Model S 60.

I am trying to plan the route from near Chatteris, Cambs to Splash landings, which we could do in one leg, but I cannot see any destination charging and they were pretty useless on the phone. They seemed to think they had a charger but it hadn't been working recently and they couldn't tell me what it was or when it would be working again...

I looked at EVTrip Planner and there are no Superchargers along the route that I would normally take and I only have my UMC cable with the 32A Commando and 13A 3-Pin Mains plugs options.

I think my best option is to travel there directly as with an ICE car, and I should have about 40 miles of range left as a guess. The next day I would leave with around 40 miles (and a cold battery) to travel 30 miles (40 minutes) in the wrong direction to Keele services where I could Supercharge to full in about 50 minutes or so. From there I could then drive straight home which should be around 2 1/2 hours again and wall charge at home over night.

I guess there is a risk that I might struggle to get to the hotel and then onto Keele the next day with a cold battery, but going to Keele on the way there will mess the day's timings up. On the way home, it will add around an hour and a half to the journey, and it's not as if Keele is at a useful rest stop mid-way through the journey.

I am pretty shocked that Alton Towers are so rubbish when it comes to destination chargers, I expected better of them.

This is my first longer distance trip and I would like to take the green option, but what's the general view, have I missed something? My heart says take the Tesla, but my head says I should just take the quicker, easier option, save the 1 1/2 hours and spend the extra £30 on diesel instead?

After increasing our output target to 500,000 cars per year by 2018, we began searching for the best engineering talent in automated manufacturing systems. Today, we are excited to announce that Tesla has entered into an agreement to acquire Grohmann Engineering, a world-renowned engineering company in Prüm, Germany, which will become Tesla Grohmann Automation.

Led by founder and CEO Klaus Grohmann, Grohmann Engineering is one of the world leaders in highly automated methods of manufacturing. This transaction will bring Mr. Grohmann’s leadership, a world-class team and unique expertise in-house. Moreover, it will serve as the initial base for Tesla Advanced Automation Germany headquarters, with other locations to follow. We expect to add over 1,000 advanced engineering and skilled technician jobs in Germany over the next two years.

It said the term gave customers ""incorrect expectations"" that they could stop concentrating on the road and let Autopilot take over completely.

...

""Tesla's Autopilot operates in conjunction with the human driver to make driving safer and less stressful. This is how the term has been used for decades in aerospace: to denote a support system that operates under the direct supervision of a human pilot,"" the company said.

""We have always been clear with our customers that Autopilot is a drivers assistance system that requires the driver to pay attention at all times.

""Just as in an airplane, when used properly, Autopilot reduces driver workload and provides an added layer of safety when compared to purely manual driving.""

877,Amsterdam via Hull ferry in the Tesla.,832,"Sep 19, 2016","So I did a trip from Nottingham to Amsterdam this weekend. Rather than drive down to the Chunnel, we took the ""party boat"" from Hull to Rotterdam. (It was after all a ""boys trip""  ). Thought it might be useful for others who might consider this over the long drive down south to get the Eurostar!

The downsides to not using the tunnel, is it feels a little less targeted as a Supercharger route. Doable on a single charge from Nottingham with a nearly full charge (around 95%) , scraping into Amsterdam with 4%, so first mild ""range anxiety"" in a while. I had planned to grab a FastNed charge whilst at a services, to give me a buffer, but unfortunately the services I pulled in to had an ONLE unit, which was phone app only and only works on Dutch issued phones  Figured overall it was faster to drive slightly slower than do another stop.

Overall I would say getting to Antwerp via the channel crossing (my last trip) is more straightforward, despite this being significantly further in road mile terms. It would probably be a slightly different story in an 85+, or if I'd done a bit more planning (which wouldn't be hard as my planning effort was basically zero  )

I was under the impression Tesla were going to put in a Tesla owner SpC location, but Taxi's were all too common at the 10 stall site outside the service centre. This meant I didn't get enough in the mandatory 40 minute limit in force there to make it back.

The car park next to the hotel, did have charging, but I only spotted it on the way out (you had to do a loop of the car park to find it), so we stopped back at the SpC on the way back to top off the batteries. More time to nosey around a couple of Model X's (and I have to say the fit and finish was shockingly bad, with both having differing faults in terms of panel line up, the display model was noticeably bad in that the roof line had a clear step where the doors were lower than the fixed part of the roof  )

I only saw one other UK registered car. Lurking in the Service Centre car park, an early P85+, with loads of sensors and wiring in the cabin. I'm 99% sure it was one of the early press fleet cars. Tesla's in general got much rarer outside Amsterdam, not seeing another one at all out near Rotterdam.

I was determined to also try a FastNED having heard all the good things. I found one just outside Rotterdam for a quick ""buffer top up"". Their app worked flawlessly, and my CHAdeMO remains unused in it's box in my car as they had one conveniently chained up. (Clearly it doesn't get much use though judging by the spider nest I had to clean out of it )

Only other observation was how the SatNav was completely useless, to the point in the end we gave up after it tried to send us on a crazy river ferry . From then on we stuck to google maps ",0.0,5,1370

I know that there is Spotify on the Tesla, but I suspect that managing Spotify Playlists outside of the car could be tricky without a Spotify Premium Account which I don't have, and I don't fancy paying £10/month for it.

So just wondering if the Tesla browser supports Amazon Music, and is it usable? That way I can use the same Playlists and favourites that I have at home on my Sonos.

Has anyone tried this, does it work?

Thanks

My thoughts:

Leeds
The hotel bar isn't too bad, club sandwiches and pizzas both pretty good value 

Warrington
Not tried the restaurant but the bar food is pretty good, if a bit pricey. Steak sandwich is highly recommended - one of the best I've had. Hand drawn beer is good

Barnsley
Bar food seems OK, although not worth anything like what they charge for it

Exeter (Darts Farm)
The farm village was closed when I went, so walked up the road to the pub there. Really nice food, pretty reasonable

964,UK sales manager contact?,2702,"Apr 29, 2016","Does anyone have the email address of someone moderately high up in Tesla UK on the sales side?
My brother's had a bit of a nightmare with his Model S order. 
He's been on the fence for a while and finally decided to take the plunge and buy a Model S. He looked over some showroom offers and weight up the difference between a new model he could spec out exactly to his liking. On the 30th March his sales manager offered a 2016 showroom model at a good price with under 3k on the clock so after a bit of deliberation be bought it .. well they took a £2k deposit down for it. Shortly after they phoned him to say that they'd made a mistake and the car was already sold. They put his deposit down against a new car that he'd roughly configured during a test drive stating that they would look for other show room cars and he could go in and change his configuration.
He felt a little annoyed at this, he'd been given a really good offer and was even wondering if the car ever did exist. He asked them to clarify how they could ""hold his order open for three weeks while they looked for alternatives"" as the email from Tesla stated it would lock after two.
After a lot of chasing for answers to his basic questions or indeed the showroom offers he'd been promised he got a reply 12 days later (yes really 12 days) stating “In the meantime, the reservation for a custom is on hold until we get you some direction.” and told him his price was locked and protected by the rise. So he looked over a couple of show room cars and decided to go with a new model. By this point his on-line configuration had of course locked so he emailed the changes to the sales manager who confirmed that “Yes I should still be able to do that for you. I’ll pass the request on and wait for confirmation of the changes.”
He then sent repeated chasing emails over the next 13 days with responses like ""I'll get onto it tomorrow"" but no actual answers. And then he of course gets an email stating ""his car"" has begun production.
They have eventually come back and said he's got two choices, take the car that's being built but not to his specification (no pano roof, no winter pack, no premium sound and £4400 worth of front motor he didn't want) or he can just scrap it all and put in another order any pay the new prices.
I'm a little baffled this appears to be a horrific case of poor customer service. I looked over his emails and he's been chasing 2/3 times a week and in total he spent 5 days deliberating over what to get and 25 days waiting on responses to about three questions one being ""why does it tell me it's going to lock my order when you are telling me it won't"".

Of interest is how de-emphasised the X is. They spent a LOT more time on the S facelift, and not a single shot of the X showing off it's main USP (the doors). 

I'm sure Tesla will have had some editorial input into this. So my take is they are expecting the S to remain the stalwart of the business, doing the ""heavy lifting"" in terms of volume and margin until the 3 hits the stores.

Finally, they still have some work to do on fit and finish

Manual here:

https://www.teslamotors.com/sites/d...ll-connector-installation-manual-en-EU-v1.pdf

Critical features:

As expected, tethered chargepoint with type2 connector and 'Tesla button' for opening the chargeport.
Supports single and 3-phase at various settings up to 32A
Appears to support non-Tesla vehicles (mentioned in the manual)
Cheap, at least in the USA - $500. Maybe £400 in UK?
Lots of temperature monitoring (connector, inside unit etc) - better than most home chargepoints.

Power sharing feature: up to 4 units can be installed on the same circuit, with a data cable between 'master' and 'slave' units to support sharing of the power. Schematic in the manual suggests this is by measuring the actual current taken, so should still work with non-Tesla vehicles.
So on the face of it an ideally-suited chargepoint for Tesla vehicles at about the same price as competing generic ones. But the option to add (maybe at a later date) slave units to allow you to charge multiple EVs without messing around and without needing a larger-than-typical home supply capacity is what makes me say it's a game-changer. Previously, you could get all these things if you tried really hard and spent lots of money, but now everything you ever wanted in a unit that's more or less the same price as 'vanilla' chargepoints - why would you install anything else?",46.0,5,7438

996,Couple of Charging Updates from Virtual Clubhouse,1401,"Apr 7, 2016","This afternoon Tesla UK held a ""virtual clubhouse"" event which rather than being at a sales centre was held over Webex.

I'm not going to share the full rundown of updates since these events are supposedly owner only in order to allow TM to speak more freely than they otherwise would.

But on charging there were some useful and not particularly sensitive updates:

Supercharging:

Expect 80-90% increase in SC bays in the UK by end 2016 (not sites, bays). Not much happening in Q2 but Q3 will be much busier.
Priorities for SCs are in all the obvious places (Anglia, Wales, etc)
8 bays minimum at all new sites, with one exception where 4 is planned.
South Mimms 12 bays should be up and running ""soon""
Destination Charging:

UK likely to be ahead of much of Europe in terms of speed of rollout; large numbers of venues waiting to get their hands on kit
Tesla provide and maintain the hardware; site owner pays for electricity
Site owner is allowed to restrict access (the example given was a charger inside a private airfield!!), or to charge for access to the parking lot the chargers are in, but may not charge for the actual, erm, charging.
Mostly 22kW, some 11kW.
For every pair of Tesla destination chargers there'll be one alongside for public access. Only Teslas wil be able to charge at the Tesla ones (even though they have standard Type 2 connectors).

997,Open-source REx?,1439,"Apr 1, 2016","I was just thinking - Tesla appear to want to stick to pure BEV, and all strength to them.

But if Elon really took a leaf out of software/internet/silicon-valley thinking, maybe what he should be doing is creating some sort of public protocol which would allow other companies to make REx's that could slot-and-plug-in into some otherwise-used-for-storage area, or even a trailer, on a Tesla vehicle. 

Let the market decide and let other companies develop REx and bring out the products to work with your platform. In the meantime you produce, and are known to produce, BEVs which give you the kudos for that, but let others dream up REx for those customers that might want to go their own way on that.

Not even two years after the delivery of the first Model S, Tesla Motors has transformed from fledgling start-up to arguably the most important car company in the world. We are not joking... Tesla is also emerging as an emblematic force in America's effort to foster high tech manufacturing job growth.

1029,Headlines of Tesla Country Director's Presentation,4122,"Jan 22, 2016","Hello,

I was at the Oxford Store opening reception yesterday. I want to give you an update in case you'd been interested.
Tesla UK country director Georg Ell made a presentation and answered some questions. He is a nice talker and young, agile guy. He reminds me Elon a bit 
Store was a regular Tesla store, with one red P90D and one skeleton.
It is located at the heart of Oxford Street, just across the Selfridges.
I didn't like the lightning of the store, it was too dark, but maybe they lowered it for the reception.
There were lots of people, we were kinda stuffed. But it was not too bad.
Free alcohol and food is always good 

Here are the headlines:

- The request for Spotify was huge in the UK. Tesla UK pushed the headquarters for the integration.
- This is a strange one: Oxford Store currently doesn't have permissions to sell&order any car yet. (Something to do with council etc) They will show the car to people, but they will direct them to internet or other store. They expect to overcome this problem soon.
-Oxford street is the most polluted street in the UK. 4 days of pollution equals a year of an average street. So Tesla is making a good point with advertising EVs in that street.
- They plan to deploy destination 160 charging points prior to hardware certification. Tesla is not chasing them always, most of the hotels etc, wants charger points so more people would visit.
- Tesla is aware that waiting time in the Europe is not good comparing to US. So they are starting induction events, to get together with people and answer their possible questions.
- Next week, Elon is coming to the UK. He'll be joining some events. (I guess I heard Queen's dinner or something)
- New superchargers are coming in 2016. Bristol, Edinburgh, Midlands etc.
- Model X will arrive to showrooms at the second half of 2016.
- Summon feature will be released after regulatory approvals.
- Tesla Energy will coming to Europe soon.
- They were paying rent for some supercharger locations. But now, since they are becoming popular, landlords of some facilities are not charging any rent for Supercharger locations. Tesla is just paying hardware cost and energy cost. At some superchargers, even energy cost is payed by the landlord.
- Elon hates queues at the Superchargers. He thinks that it is a virality killer. They plan to expand existing superchargers too. They plan to build stations with at least 8-12 stalls.
QAs:
- Speedcamera warning in sat nav - unlikely.
- Referral program - They liked the first phase, but not the second, because people were sharing their codes everywhere. The point of the program is not getting a discount, it is about sharing customer stories and making people buy. They are redesigning referral schema.
- Tesla is willing to learn about problems and bugs. Please send problems, make a bug report.
- 3rd Party SDK - low priority
- Apple car play - Unlikely
- UI redesign - will come with v7.2. Hopefully with new browser. Video unlikely.
- Autopilot v2 - no comment.

1040,Impact of Supercharger cost to Tesla,3849,"Jan 9, 2016","Hi All,

I've been following the fortunes of Tesla since they started and have read a lot in the press and on the investor forums about the company including lots from the short sellers in particular on ow the business is unsustainable. The Supercharger network is one big differentiator from other companies that helped my decision to go for a Model S so I started thinking about what the network actually costs using the UK as an example.

Firstly leases need to be negotiated, these could be expensive but I suspect there's a very good argument to landlords that the provision of Superchargers will benefit their business - captive customers for at leat 20 mins so plenty of opportunity to sell coffees, snacks etc - more so than with normal casual stoppers just using the facilities for a toilet break. As a result I would be surprised if the lease costs are that expensive.

Next is the hardware - this is designed in house and if I understand correctly uses the same charger blocks fitted to the Model S as either a single or a dual installation just as a stack of 11 per pair of Supercharger stations. Cost is likely to be in the region of £2,000 max per pair as a one off cost.

I have no idea on the installation costs - these could be quite substantial because of the power requirements but again probably negotiable against usage - also a one off cost.

Maintenance cost I suspect is low - the only moving parts are the cable and plug and these wouldn't be a major cost item to replace periodically.

Then we get to the cost of charging. Commercial electricity rates vary but a typical rate for a high user would probably fall in the range 7-10p/kWh. For the sake of this estimate I've gone for 8p. Most users will be charging at home or their workplace so generally the Superchargers will be used for longer journeys. In my case that means about one long journey out of range of my home charger every two weeks. For the sake of argument I'll assume one trip every week charging once on each leg for 30 mins at an average rate of 60 kW. That makes a total energy usage of 60kWh per week or £4.80 in electricity costs. Assuming I do long journeys for 50 weeks in the year that makes the total electrical cost £240. The charge for Supercharger access on the S60 was £2,500 if memory serves me correctly so at this rate that would cover over 10 years of normal charging paid up front. The hardware and installation costs probably run to a few £100 per car sold currently in the UK so in simple terms about 10 years of usage is covered in the initial £2,500 car payment - a small proportion of the selling cost. 

My basic conclusion is that provision of the Supercharger network is an incredibly clever move that swings the balance in favour of selecting the Model S over a normal ICE and at a cost that is easily sustainable and mostly paid up front by the customers. I don't have a good estimate for the difference in sales volume that would occur should the network not be there, but I suspect it would be a large one, maybe in the order of half the current sales?

Nissan have also made some efforts to provide a charging network for their customers, but this mostly seems to be dealer based with limited reliability. There is also a link up with Ecotricity who have to be applauded for their electric highway concept but here again the reliability seems to be an issue. Where Tesla scores again is they've designed and built their own kit plus they only have to cope with one plug standard which simplifies things considerably.

Am I missing something here - the short sellers claim the Supercharger network is a massive unsustainable burden on Tesla that will bring the company down. My conclusion is that they're smoking dope!!!",26.0,5,2828

1050,Got a loaner for Christmas,639,"Dec 23, 2015","With impeccable timing, the dreaded ""12v Battery needs Service"" error popped up at the weekend. Knowing that this fault is one of those errors that is either just an annoying warning, or is very quickly terminal, I decided not to risk the Christmas road trip and called Tesla Service to get it sorted.

Swapping out a 12V battery is normally a pretty quick thing to do, but due to the high number of new cars coming in, they just could not spare the time. So they gave me a loaner for Christmas instead.

The car they gave me is a Blue S85 with about 700 miles on the clock (VIN is in the 83k range). The only optional extras are NG seats and the sunroof. No powered liftgate, no auto-folding mirrors, standard audio, coil suspension and it is still running V6.2, so no Autopilot (bummer). My car is a P and pretty loaded, except I don't have the NG seats, Autopilot. Both cars have 19"" wheels.

The differences are night and day. 

The loaner is quieter, and feels quite a lot lighter. Road noise is substantially muted, there is no real noise from the motor even when pressing on, and the braking system is silent (no vaccum pump?!) when mine would usually buzz away. Being on coils must help as well, as there is no compressor to whir away. The coils are really good, they just make the car sit a bit higher than air (default) which is no big deal.

The NG seats are absolutely fantastic. I have a serious problem with the original ""premium sports seats"", the NG seats feel just perfect. The new steering wheel is a nice improvement, but the re-arrangement of the control stalks is taking a while to get used to.

There are loads and loads of other little changes around the car too : wing mirrors seem smaller, the padded arm rest has more padding, the frunk lid feels really solid now, and glove box seems muc sturdier.

Power wise, the car does feel slower off the lights, but as we all know, there is no difference at overtaking speeds. And it is still faster from zero than most other cars around.

The only thing I really dislike is the standard audio system. But that is just a personal thing.

TL;DR - I am surprised at just how good a new ""bog standard"" S85 with NG seats actually is. Yes, I would miss the folding mirrors, premium audio and power lift gate , but if you need to save a few quid, just leave them all off the options list.",28.0,4,2803

1055,Tesla Autopilot spat,68,"Dec 21, 2015","So it seems that Tesla are not happy that someone is making ""fanciful"" claims about developing machine learning autopilot..
Correction to article: ""The First Person to Hack the iPhone Built a Self-Driving Car"" | Tesla Motors

The original story is here.. The First Person to Hack the iPhone Built a Self-Driving Car. In His Garage.

It seems that George Hotz (http://comma.ai/) is applying machine learning algorithms to autopilot and if what Ashlee (ex Register reporter) has reported is correct George seems to be making some good progress.. I'm not so convinced that George's Hardware is up to the required standard but that is an easy fix for later..

I actually think that machine learning is probably a very good way to go for autopilot, It'll likely yield much better recognition of traffic objects, and road boundaries, that human written code.

I am again concerned that Tesla are again saying they have added much more to MobileEye's product, yet all the other working versions (Infinity, BMW, Mercedes) seem to use the same sensor suite (Forward Radar, Forward Camera and Ultrasound) So other than feeding back data to be crunched just what have they added??

What is clear is that MobileEye's offering is nothing new (the 1994 Prometheus video shows that, with every feature of the Tesla AP, demonstrated 20 years ago.. way before machine learning could be applied) it kind of leads one to wonder if Tesla have been sold an 'old' system wrapped up in lots of modern marketing spin...

A couple of questions - I'm not familiar with these sockets
- can I use the socket to safely run garden equipment (or possibly tasteful Christmas lights) using an adapter? (I see lots are for sale online, popular with campers)
- I thought they might come in handy when I visit family in Wales as there are very few EV charge points in their area but lots of campsites, however a quick search here revealed the Tesla UMC won't work because although the socket is the same they usually supply a lower (16A) current - see e.g. 

New product ideas? what would you like us to stock for you? are we missing something?

This refers to a DIY adapter but I'd rather something ready built as I wouldn't know how to check any wiring is safe with sustained high currents.

1071,First Supercharging Trip... (Not good),832,"Oct 12, 2015","I have to say it was pretty disappointing 

So Nottingham to Gosport, weekend sailing, then drive back. 

I had enough range to drive the whole way there (180 miles) but no destination charging at the marina, so we stopped at Winchester (despite the sat nav insisting we needed an extra stop at Northampton).

Get to Winchester (Badgers Farm) around 7:30pm on a Thursday night, and both stalls occupied (no drivers around). 5 minutes later another car pulls up. Had a chat with him (Tesla Employee over from the States, looking into Thatcham approval for the onboard tracker, but that's a different thread  ).

10 minutes later, one of the cars leaves and we plug in. 20 mins of charging is plenty enough for Gosport and back to Winchester for the return leg, but then we only needed +50 miles, and left as soon as we hit 100 miles remaining. Get to Gosport with > 65 miles of range, and park the car up for the weekend.

Have a great weekend sailing, but tide is tough on the drag back from Yarmouth to Gosport, so we get back a little later than planned, and still facing a long drive home. But it's 4:30 on a Sunday, so even with a stop for a boost we should get back by 9:00.

Get to Winchester at 17:30, both stalls again occupied. Sat their for 30 minutes, with no facilities waiting for the other guys to finish.. Another Tesla turns up and is obviously not happy that he's go to traipse over to the other site. Finally one of the guys finishes. Turns out he's had the car <2 weeks, and lives nearby and was filling up to 100%  

So we get on the charger, and it keeps saying ""Unable to charge, please try again"", do this 5 or six times, leave the cable plugged in and phone Tesla. They say the car's battery is at perfect charging temp, and it should be working. Then a big dieselly sounding noise from a cabin near the SC hardware compound, and miraculously the car starts to charge, just at @ 60kW. Hmm going to be here a while, bored I go and investigate the cabin thing and there are hulking great cables out the back of it. Is it a battery backup that's flat, or is there a diesel generator inside it ?

The other cart then leaves, so I thought I'd try that stall and see if 60kW went up... nope.

After 15 minutes the car then decides to change route and make me stop at the Oxford, not Northampton Supercharger, as it had originally planned. Now I knew the Northampton SC was at a nice location (the Hotel), so we ignored it and hung on for another 10 minutes to get up to a 15 mile buffer for Northampton. Time spent at Winchester well over an hour to get 90 miles of charge.

Drive to Northampton, and Tesla somewhat redeem themselves. No queue and charging at a decent rate. Works under way for 3 more stalls, but a hulking great diesel gen set powering everything.

Go inside for a drink and bowl of chips, come back out and the car has 150 miles on it, more than enough to get home.... only problem was this was now 22:30. An easy 4 hour ICE journey, turned into a 6 hour journey, and ironically used just as much diesel!!!

Pretty clear these two bay sites are going to need serious beefing up to avoid congestion. Tesla need to rethink some of the locations without facilities, and they need to get on top of freeload chargers for this to become scalable for the Model 3.

Next time I take the trip it will probably be in an ICE (or a really long extension cable, and speak nicely to the marina to use their shore power which have been FAR more convenient)",52.0,0,5281

But it's interesting at about 7:40, Llewellyn goes into full eco, hippy, tree hugger, 'save the polar bears', anti-car mode, and goes a bit mad bashing people who buy/drive 'luxury' ICE cars....Yet he than goes on to praise the Model S, forgetting the fact his Model S at 373bhp, 5.4 0-60 nearly matches the performance of the latest hyper hatches from the companies he seem to hate so much 










There has been some discussion before about if Tesla can become a brand that can serve both the high-end market via a £60-70K Model S, as well as the lower end £20K with the Model 3. I still have no doubts if Tesla can pull of that trick, but it's no small feat to attract praise (and custom) from a seasoned green tech lover like Llewellyn whilst at the same time winning over some of the most die-hard petrol heads (which I count my self).

I cannot think of another car model from any other other brand currently on-sale that is capable of attracting such a diverse customer base??

But other than telling us it was four years down the road (Tesla time) and that it would come in Maximum Plaid, he didn’t give away much. What might we expect?

There are a few things we know. It will accelerate like a Formula One car, at least to 60, and it should have a 400-mile range (can’t see it giving up range over that promised in the 3.0 upgrade). This should put it squarely in the Supercar class, competing with Ferraris, McLarens, Lamborghinis, and top-line Porsches. No doubt it will struggle a bit to keep up on the track (given its extra weight) but it should be considerably cheaper than its competitors in that class. My suspicion is that this is the route Tesla will take; they’ll want it to be their top-of-the-line car – the one everyone talks about but relatively few can actually afford. If they go this route, we can be certain that the car will not share any Lotus genes. It will bear its very own design, probably done in-house.

I hope I am wrong. My preference is for a two-seat sports car priced mid-way between the Model S 90 and the Model 3. This would put it in the same class as the base Cayman, Evora, Alfa 4C and perhaps the F-Type, and not too far above a well-optioned Z4, Elise S, or Audi TTS (or an MX-5 with a Rolex in the glove box). This scenario may not be too far fetched if, by then, Tesla, with its gigafactory chugging along at full steam, has a surplus of batteries that it needs to use (and it certainly won’t use many in a low-production supercar).

Whatever direction the company takes, I hope its next Roadster is a car that more that a few can experience.",7.0,0,1563

Tesla’s Supercharger-Scofflaw Note Irks Some Model S Owners - Bloomberg Business

I have always been amazed by this model offered by Tesla, the free fuel for life thing? I think its a great idea however I have always worried that it would be abused (as are some of the Ecotricty chargers) it seems there are some local MS owners who rather than do what most do and get some solar PV and charge from home they are instead using local superchargers to run their cars all the time.

We all know in using the Ecotricty network that this model of free fuel is a fun gimmick to draw folks over to the other side and we all know that it is not a model that is sustainable as not only does it not pay it is frequently misused, if we all agree that rapid charging is there to enable long trips and not to provide free fuel for local ev owners.

I understand at first that supercharger access was a paid extra but it is now built in and I assume the price is hidden in the make up of the car, some of the supercharger sites are getting very busy so I have been reading now that's fine if they are owners who are on long trips, or locals with no option to charge at home, but not as cool if they are locals with home charging who are using the charger.

I think as more Model S hit the road they are going to have a problem that will be improved by the installation of more superchargers however unless you site the superchargers on motorways you run the risk of them being used by locals.

Its a tricky one to manage as in London of course some model S owners have to use their local superchargers as they have no off road parking, if anyone can manage this properly though it is Tesla, I am sure that they already have measures in place for taxi companies and such like? else they will have to as you could effectively run a taxi service with no fuel costs! hmmm 

I hope that Model S owners are sensible and don't push this else the free fuel for life model may change or be tied up with an acceptable usage policy it may already be in the small print, Tesla could easily limit the amount of rapid charges any one individual car could make if they thought the system was being abused.

I hope that this levels off and doesn't get worse, how many model S owners have had to wait at super chargers here in the UK? and have you chatted to drivers to see where they are from when you stopped there?

Free fuel for life seems to good to be true to me? and to second that I hope that Ecotricity start charging as soon as possible too. As Tesla roll out software updates I wouldn't be surprised if an acceptable usage clause is hidden in the terms and conditions, you know this bit nobody reads and just presses OK 

When we get our Model S we will hardly ever use the superchargers if that helps ",49.0,0,4254
1105,"""All you can eat"" pricing, and when people start taking the...",832,"Mar 18, 2015","Just like many may moan about free rapids, and their use by PHEVs, it seems the problem isn't isolated to Ecotricity.

It looks like Tesla are struggling with more people than expected using Supercharging over home charging in order to save money on their electricity bills, and are experimenting with ways to combat it 

My speculation is that a combination of many more charging sessions than was budgeted for, as well as the demand being ""spikey"" in commute times is bursting demand rates, and this is really hurting Tesla's OPEX budget 

Tesla have been very careful with their wording over Supercharger pricing, to avoid it being ""income in advance"". It's free for 85s and 60s pay an ""enablemement fee"", not a ""lifetime usage fee"". In both cases their is no unearned future revenues, so they can claim all the profit in the first year.

They have set aside provisions for costs arising from electricity, but it isn't necessarily the $2k per car, that's often quoted due to the 60 enablement fee. (The actual figure is buried in with a load of other figures on their filings, and isn't in the public domain, and I would expect a fair bit lower than $2k per car)

No doubt they will have modelled it based on a prediction of how many times on average the cars charge. My suspicion being they got this prediction wrong, and they didn't count on quite how crazy people can be to get something ""Free""
.
They've changed the wording subtly on the advert for Supercharging to:
""Superchargers are free connectors that charge Model S in minutes instead of hours. Stations are strategically placed to minimize stops during long distance travel and are conveniently located near restaurants, shopping centers, and WiFi hot spots. Each station contains multiple Superchargers to help you get back on the road quickly.""

Rumours are rife that heavy Supercharger usage owners are experiencing throttled (to 60kW) at local Superchargers, but they are getting full charge rates at further a field. (I think someone even removed their home location from the GPS and claimed they then got full rates)

Owners reports coming in from across US, Canada, Japan and Norway. One guy took his car to the service centre and specifically asked about the issue, and was told it's expected behaviour, and a corporate announcement is coming.

I highly doubt they'd bring capping into the UK right now (given London's parking constraints, and high target audience/ownership levels), but it is certainly interesting for the future landscape of the business model.

Could Thursday's announcement also include a change in policy for Tesla Supercharger usage?

1110,Oxford 6 bay supercharger and test drives,48,"Aug 5, 2015","
























Went to the new 6 bay super charger today, Tesla were doing test drives, I have had a test drive before but wanted to try out a right hand drive car.

Its still amazing what a big car this is, we did a little film with my opinions about the drive you can watch on my channel, I didnt film the drive or the rep interview as thats not very fair on them and there are loads of acceleration videos.

Im still loving the car despite the size, the new trim is much better than the gen-1 cars it feels like its been tweaked a lot, ride on the normal coil shocks is nice too, it does feel like a heavy car when turning at low speed but acceleration is mind blowing, I literally couldnt believe it, I have never accelerated like that before even on a roller coaster.

The services here are really nice too, we pulled in at the normal rapids which were showing offline but they were both working? we have a 6.6kw Leaf Tekna so we pulled in the bay with just the post in rather than hog a rapid for an hour, this worked great, after just 40 mins our car was back to full charge after a 30 mile drive from full, its such a shame that there are not more of these posts around at rapid sites.

We are seriously considering the Model S as a second car to the Leaf next year, the rep told me we would be looking at a 4 month lead time from the placement of an order, even more for dual drive.

We want to have a go in the P85D and have been told that we can in a few weeks, we will have to go to the heathrow showroom for that.

It was nice to see plenty of folks pouring over the car and taking test drives, placing the red car right at the entrance was a smart move however it wasnt immediately obvious where you had to go for the test drives, the only clue was the Tesla flags on the path leading away and up to the superchargers.

This is a prime site for Tesla, they must be over the moon, its in an ideal location, has 6 bays and all the local amenities are there, this would not have been possible before they settled with ecotricty.

Tesla owners must be pleased with the rapid deployment of the superchargers, we did think after the drive the Leaf would feel second rate, I was surprised to find that it didnt (the Tekna and the leather seats and wheel helps) in fact the Tekna steering wheel feels very much like the Tesla wheel.

Big thanks to Tesla for the test drive, you simply have to try one, even if you cant afford one, try one and tell your friends that can afford one or better still all go on a test drive.

I was amazed and I am used to the smoothness, acceleration and quietness of an electric car, I really dont think Nissan have much to worry about, these car are in different markets and different leagues, its BMW, Lexus, Mercedes, Ferrari etc etc that need to worry, the infernal combustion engine is dying and dying very fast.

1112,Tesla owner referral scheme,797,"Aug 1, 2015","As Bjørn Nyland explains in a YouTube video on his channel this week (linked below) Tesla are trialling a referral scheme for Tesla owners.

Update: Thanks to @Dennis for the Roadster confirmation (corrected). Also the official Tesla page is found here (didn't take much Googling): Referral Program | Tesla Motors Also @dpeilow confirmed £1,000 equivalent for UK owners. FYI - I'm sure you're fascinated - I also updated some Bjorn's to Bjørn's.






Caveat: I'm not a Tesla owner so I'm not reciting this information first hand. If you are (an owner) - you should get the deets from Tesla - don't take my word for all this...

The salient details seem to be:

Refer new buyers with your hyperlink code to receive $1,000 Tesla credit
Referred buyer receives $1,000 off their car
Limited to a maximum of 10 referrals per owner
Code takes the buyer to the Design Studio to spec their purchase
Trial scheme runs until end of October 2015
Credits must be spent on Tesla cars or accessories
Credits expire end of December 2016
To further sweeten the pot, Tesla are throwing some extra incentives out there:

Reach 5 referrals and you'll receive an invitation to the grand opening of Gigafactory 1 in 2016 (but you'll still have to pay for transport and accommodation)
Reach 10 referrals and you have an option to purchase a fully loaded Model X Founders Edition for the base price
The first referrer to 10 in each of North America, Europe and Asia Pacific will receive a free Model X
I'll anticipate some of your questions:

$1,000? What's that in £ or € or whatever my local currency is?
£1,000 in the UK is confirmed by @dpeilow. We don't know about currency conversions or equivalent value elsewhere. Bjørn reports $1,000 from the US announcement of the scheme. Who knows? Sorry.
Can anybody refer buyers?
No, you need to be a Tesla owner
Can Roadster owners refer buyers?
I don't think Tesla have specifically addressed this question yet. But Dennis confirms the referral code is there in your Roadster account page.
How do you get your code?
I believe it's available in your Tesla account (so, only available to customers)
What's the Model X Founders Edition?
Good question. No details yet, but as Bjørn points out it'll probably be like the Signature edition vehicles as a special, limited run car with perhaps a special paint colour and some other goodies.
Why do you have full stops at the end of some bullet point answers and not others?
Stop being pedantic
So if you're about to buy and don't already know someone who has a Tesla Model S or Roadster, I'm sure all you owners on here will be happy to share your referral codes on the forum. Maybe if someone's helped you out and helpfully answered a pre-sales question they deserve your click.

If you're still stuck for one, you can help Bjørn get to ten as he obviously shares his underneath the video on YouTube (link above).",14.0,2,2473

1127,Tesla Q2 2015 results....another record delivery quarter,2143,"Jul 3, 2015","So it seems despite cheap oil, the Model S been on-sale for a few years, imment arrival of the Model X and not spending any money on advertising, Tesla delivered more cars than ever before, over 11,000 cars. That's a 50% increase compared to Q2 2014 (which was about a 50% increase from Q3 2015).

The 'average' sale price of the Model S was $100k in 2014, if this has remained the same in Q2 of 2015, that gives Tesla a turnover of $1100 Million for Q2 2015....Still small numbers compared to BMW, the car division turns over €19,000 Million per quarter. BUT that's through sales of 500,000 per quarter, which means the 'average' BMW sells for €38,000 - quite a bit cheaper than a Model S, and for a much smaller profit margin, 25% versus 10%...The real scary thing for BMW, Tesla's profit margin on each car is only just going to increase year - on - year, due to falling battery costs, for an investor looking at the bottom line, Tesla is doing very well.

I suspect if Tesla can deliver the Model X on time, they will smash their 55,000 delivery target this year. People love SUVs, and 'premium' SUVs sell, there's more Range Rovers on the roads than XJ jags. I know there is debate about the 'falcon doors', but when one parent pulls up at the school gates and the sprogglings emerge from that Model X through those doors, and than glide away in silence rather than a diesel rattle, I think the kids are going to go mental for one. The kids in my area love pointing at the Leaf, god knows how they would react to a Model X and its Falcon doors, I know the big kid inside me loves the look of them, they might still be USP that makes me pre-order a Model X over a S ...and pester power of kids is one thing that ever brand would love to have 

The over all numbers are still tiny, but with just one car (very expensive car), Tesla is already achieving 5-6% the turn over of BMW - with a much bigger profit margin. If I was BMW I would be looking very nervously behind my shoulder, the Gigafactory is ahead of schedule and apparently due to start production in 12 months, and if Tesla continues their growth and hits 500,000 a year by 2020 (only 5 years away), they going to represent some serious competition for BMW...After all both Tesla and BMW are chasing the same market, 500,000 more Tesla buyers will mean 500,000 less BMW/Audi/Merc buyer.

And I finally got the opportunity to do so last Wednesday.

This made me think about the CPO program (which we took advantage of to obtain her Roadster (Signature #40, previously owned by someone known for playing a ""Forgetful Spy"" and has a best friend who is Batman)) that we operate under with the Roadster and the CPO program that folks are now purchasing used Model S under.

Granted, this is based on the US models of this same program. But it really is a good deal, with the continuing exception of not providing, in writing, a battery degradation warranty as part of that program.

It also provided me the opportunity to play with both Periscope and Meerkat.

1133,What comes as standard with the Tesla for charging?,502,"Jun 2, 2015","Hi. 
As a very excited soon to be Model S owner I wanted to check what I get as standard with the car.

I read that we just get the type 2 lead now. Is this correct? The reasoning for questioning is that I have just had a generic email from Tesla that says ""what comes with the model S"" and its says...

What comes standard with Model S?

-A 6 meter long Mobile Connector to connect with the different adapters.

-A Blue adapter for an industrial socket to charge the Model S up to 22 miles of range per hour.

-An adapter with the 3 pin domestic plug to connect to the Mobile Connector and to charge up to 6 miles of range per hour.

It would be great to get the adapter as I can easily buy a Type 2 lead for less than the adapter.

Also can anyone enlighten me as to if I will get mats?


Thanks

Over the rest of the day I tried Heston West,Baldock and Cambridge all worked first time..

It seems there are some issues with the ecotricity pumps so tesla have limited the adaptor to a max current of 75a this seems to be in line with my tests, this translates to about 25kw or 76miles for an hour of charge.

I have not tested on other types of chademo yet to see what the results are, however as another tool in my charging arsenal is very useful and I expect it will see quite a bit of use this year.

LiPo4 packs for model helicopters offer 30C discharge routinely whereas the NCR 18650 seems to be specified to 1.5C.

1147,Why does a Model S get a £5k grant?,1439,"May 25, 2015","I dunno why, but feel a bit grumpy today and posted this on leaftalk.

Please discuss and let me know if this is right, or why it is wrong:-

There is no logic to the Gov giving £5k grant towards a Model S. Firstly, if you can't afford the £5k yourself then why take one in the first place, and secondly it totally undoes the point of the grant, which is to promote lower CO2.

An EV with a ~24kWh pack will help reduce lifetime CO2 by about 30% to 50% to an equivalent ICE, but an EV with a 85kWh pack will always emit more CO2 that a family hatch ICE of equal practical use.

If you buy one, then send OLEV a cheque for £5k and say you didn't need that money and don't want to screw folks with lower income than yourself for your choice to buy a +£50k electric barge.",88.0,1,5750

1150,"Tesla supercharging times compared S85, S85D ,SP85D, X85D, XP85D",987,"May 9, 2015","Supercharging speed slows down after 80% charge. This is known tapering curve. On Tesla website here, it shows this graph:










As you see 80% takes 40 minutes. Because all 85 kWh Teslas have the same battery, they will charge to same percentage at same time. All will charge from zero to 80% in 40 minutes. However, 80% of Model S 85D range is 270*0.8= 216 mi. 80% of Model X 85D range is 243*0.8= 194.4 mi. When you are at a supercharger, your range is what matters. This is the thought process:

Arrive at a supercharger
Check distance to destination.
Add some buffer for the unexpected
Add some buffer for air conditioning
Calculate total range you need when you leave
Wait until you reach that range
Using the same numbers on that green graph, I recreated it on a Google document here:
Google Sheet: Tesla supercharging times compared

Model X range is estimated 10% less than Model S according Elon's statement in this video. Watch from 32:34. At 32:58 he says ""energy consumption will be about 10% greater per kilometre"". This is as clear as it gets.

These are screenshots from that file. This is full size version:









This is zoomed in version of same chart, so you can read the numbers easier:










Conclusions

Paying $20,000 (£13,000) extra for performance version doesn't always get you more. Supercharging to 225 miles is 5 minutes slower in SP85D and 7 min slower in XP85D, than their non performance D versions. Supercharging to 250 miles is 11 minutes slower in SP85D than S85D.

The XP85D is the worst choice for long distance family trips.
If somebody is planning lots of long distance family trips they should buy S85D instead X85D if they want 9 minutes faster supercharging.
The assumption that all 85 kWh Teslas would require the same supercharging time is incorrect. Tesla order page shows 0-60 times, top speed, HP and price, but it doesn't show a rather important detail which is supercharging time. Buyers should be aware those times are not the same. 

Some interesting data from the graph:

225 miles supercharge takes 43 min in S85D
225 miles supercharge takes 48 min in SP85D
225 miles supercharge takes 52 min in X85D
225 miles supercharge takes 65 min in XP85D

Tesla is aiming to reveal the Model 3, its answer to BMW's 3-series, in March 2016. CEO Elon Musk announced the target date during today's call with Tesla investors. ""We are hoping to show the Model 3 in March of next year,"" he said. Musk emphasized that the date is tentative and plans could change in the months ahead. But right now, that's the goal. Production of the Model 3, which will be able to drive 200 miles on a single charge, would start in mid or late 2017. ""Late 2017 is probably more realistic,"" Musk added.

1155,Thanks all,2373,"Apr 23, 2015","Just a thank you to all who post on here. I have researched a fair bit on various Forums and found this one to be excellent.

The outcome is that I have just put my deposit on a Titanium 70D.

It has come after a fair bit of pondering as I'm normally a 'sitting-on-the-fence'er' rather than an early adopter. However, I spend £300-400 on fuel per month feeding the (lovely but) thirsty 4.2L V8 in my Audi RS4 and have convinced myself that the figures on a 70D actually add up to cheap ownership. I keep my cars for ages (usu 5-8 years) which offsets depreciation and as my bank will lend me money at 3% over 8 years, the repayments less savings in fuel and road tax do look like good value.

I test drove the 85D last week-end and was amazed about the acceleration (and the RS4 is no slouch!) and the general drivability and practicality of it. Although I didn't realise just how big it is!

I drive 15-20000 miles per year but rarely more than 70-80 miles per day, so big overall range is not a regular issue for me. At one of my places of work, Sainsburys next door have 2 charging ports, so I plan to make that a regular car parking spot for a few hours. Spoke to one of the employees about usage and she told me that 'no-one is ever there'. And I of course plan to leave a number, if someone needs to use it as I'm literally next door.

I shall keep watching the forum and wait with excitement, and hope that Tesla delivers in August as currently indicated. The colour was a tricky one, but a light metallic a must as car washing is not a great hobby of mine. This rules out the darker colours - although the new blue was very tempting. I do like the look of the Titanium but hope it's not too beige/bronze in real life.

Clearly Tesla isn't a normal car company, and with the long delivery times and quite frequent model changes, how does the ordering process actually work?? So I have a few questions:

1) How accurate is the delivery time-scale on the website. Currently the 70D says 'Late August'. Is the predicted times correct in peoples experience?? I don't want to order the car next August, for a Feb/March delivery time, but than come to find come Feb/March the date is pushed back to May/June....Which would leave me car-less

2) If I do order a 70D next year (who knows what the model range will actually look like), and 2 weeks later a 75D comes out for a similar price...Does Tesla let you change the oder, and keep your production slot?? Or is it a case of change your order and you go to the back of the line?

3) I've seen the finance bit on the website, I presume, that's just normal HP/Loan. But do Tesla offer any official personal Lease contracts??

4) If buying out-right, I presume you pay a holding deposit, and than pay Tesla the final full amount at time of delivery?? (ie: Tesla aren't crazy and demand the whole amount upfront)

The long-awaiting SDK for the car is still MIA.

I really wonder when car manufacturers will finally see the light? Every foray into vehicle SDKs that I've seen is a complete joke. It took Apple a year or two with the iPhone to realise that an App ecosystem builds brand loyalty, stickiness of the platform, and increases the attractiveness of the product.

Firstly I recieved the notice of a new update to the cars software while I was traveling on business, since there is no way to do this remotely I forgot about it until returning. When I got back to the car it showed the update screen but the touch screen was not responding, no problems I thought do the tesla version of ctrl alt del and all will be well, however after the reboot the update disappeared, seems it get flushed when you reboot.

So I contacted telsa support and asked what to do, no problems lets push you an update right now, and seconds later the download began.

The second annoyance was that the velco that holds the car mats in place had become separated from the bottom of the mat and had doubled over sticking the sticky part to itself. I asked them to send me a new set of velco pads, expecting a quick fix, but no they insisted on sending me a full new set of mats, 10 mins after getting the email asking for my address I had a TNT notification they were on the way.

The problem is not only directly at startup, it lasts for a little while. Heard today about someone who trampled pedal straight to the bottom. Should have been mainly in VG really. Must it a fatality before it is taken seriously?


I pedaled and the pedal at the bottom when I would park a little while ago. It was nearly 0 in braking. I stopped 2cm in from a concrete wall. Got driving ban in from Tesla and they ensured that the Viking came and fetched the car and gave me a lånebil.Top service and very good follow on Viking came as agreed.
After that I realized they could not find any fault but they switched discs and pads rear pads front and mounted new type brake shields. Now in retrospect I've got error P a couple of times that it is not certain that the brake is on and the vehicle can roll.Moreover there came a bang / dunk yesterday while driving. When I arrived at Gardermoen shows that the tail / brake hanger left bakjul. Luckily, the car into Tesla Drammen 20 'service yesterday. The trip from Oslo airport to Drammen went and brakes on with varying degrees of scratching noises and hoot.

Experienced for the first time the other day zero braking effect. The car was cold had been the work day without recharging and had zero regen. Come down a hill in 40-50 against a roundabout pressed into brake a little, some resistance in 2-3 cm so just shook pedal and went completely to bottom. Got little freaked and tried pump but still went straight to the bottom 2-3 times. As there was no other option than to gander at to avoid bonustap. Jaggu important routine check that things work.

The brakes do not work at all for 2-3 seconds and the pedal goes all the way to the floor several times without effect is mildly unsettling. That it is cold or the vehicle has been washed is no excuse, there is something to work 110% of the time on a car, so it is then damn brakes ??

Pedal goes basically tacos slows in cold / wet weather is about two different problems? Have experienced the past a few times and it is extremely disgusting. Have you properly bad luck I have no doubt that this has the potential to cause very serious accidents, such as driving on someone who comes out a little unexpected in a pedestrian crossing, or driving someone from behind. Give it enough time so will such a event will pop up and it could be disastrous for Tesla.
Have also experienced at least one time that only brake on the one hand is bad, which then gets the car to pull out the side.

1189,"""Destination Charging"" -- the Fast-Growing Network Beyond Superchargers",639,"Jan 23, 2015","Nice piece on Motley Fool about how Tesla are getting into destination charging in the US.

""Tesla's Alexis Georgeson explained to The Motley Fool how the Destination Charging network and the Supercharger network complement each other in an effort to make traveling in a Tesla as convenient as possible:

Our growing Supercharger network has inspired Model S owners to hit the road in increasing numbers. Owners can drive all day, charging for 30-40 minutes at Superchargers, and then stop at night to stay at one of the many hotels and resorts that have installed Tesla High Power Connectors. By offering convenient Destination Charging services to Model S owners, these locations are replicating the convenience our owners have become accustomed to at home. Owners wake up relaxed with a full charge and ready to hit the road again.

It's clear that the Destination Charging locations Tesla is choosing are locations where owners would likely be staying for about 45 minutes or more -- long enough to get a meaningful charge from a Wall Connector.

Like Tesla's Supercharger network, these Wall Connectors are free for Tesla owners.

Compelling economics

The economics for all parties involved are compelling.

The cost of the Wall Connector is minimal; the company sells the contraption on its website for $650. And the installation of a 240-volt circuit isn't expensive -- probably no more than $3,000 and as little as $500.

Who pays for the electricity? The charging partners, Georgeson says.""

These ""charging partners"" are visible on Tesla's Find Us page, so I guess this would drive extra business to the destination that maybe wouldn't have gone there otherwise.

1190,New Superchargers at Eclipse Park,1,"Jan 21, 2015","








Press release from Tesla: 

Tesla has opened a new Supercharger station in Maidstone, Kent. This latest addition to the Supercharger network is part of a rapid expansion that will soon allow UK Model S owners to drive anywhere in the country and on the continent. Supercharging is free for Supercharger-enabled vehicles.

The Maidstone Superchargers are located at Eclipse Park, which is managed by the Gallagher Group and conveniently located just off the M20, at Junction 7. The Superchargers can be accessed in the car park, which offers free parking to Model S owners whilst charging. Located on the route from London to Folkestone, the Maidstone Superchargers give easy access to the Eurotunnel and beyond to Europe.

“The Maidstone Superchargers are an exciting addition to the network, enabling travel through Europe from the UK and for our European owners to be able to drive easily into the UK,” said Georg Ell, Tesla’s UK Country Director. “Currently, the European network extends down to the south of France and Italy, and up to Norway and Sweden.”

Cllr Malcolm Greer, Cabinet Member at Maidstone Borough Council, said: “I am delighted that Maidstone will form part of Tesla’s European supercharging infrastructure. It is a massive leap forward in electric car technology. The idea of being able to travel across the UK and the continent without generating pollution or having to pay for fuel is not only good for the environment but also good for the wallet. I was very pleased to hear that our planners were able to turn this application around in six weeks to meet Tesla’s timetable.”

In the last few weeks, the Supercharger network has been strengthened with new locations in Exeter, Warrington, Heathrow, Bristol and the UK’s largest Supercharger station in Westfield White City taking the total to 17 stations in the UK. Tesla plans full UK and Ireland coverage by the end of next year to enable travel throughout the British Isles.

WORLD’S LARGEST FAST-CHARGING NETWORK

Model S’s unmatched range and Supercharger network make long distance travel easy for drivers. A Supercharger replenishes half a charge in as little as 20 minutes. Supercharger stations are strategically placed along well-travelled routes to allow Model S owners to drive long distances with minimal stops. In the UK, Superchargers stretch from Exeter to Edinburgh and links to the European Supercharger network via Maidstone. The European network extends from Northern Norway to Italy and Slovenia. Supercharging is free for Supercharger-enabled vehicles.

Tesla has energised more than 300 Supercharger stations with over 1600 Superchargers worldwide, making it both the largest and the fastest-growing fast-charging network in the world. In Europe, there are 123 Supercharger stations with over 660 Superchargers. For all Supercharger locations, visit www.teslamotors.com/en_GB/Supercharger",7.0,0,1520

1216,Free Superchargers A Strategic Mistake?,37,"Nov 26, 2014","I discussed this issue recently in Spain with a number of Model S drivers and I was interested to see some public discussion on the Tesla Motors forum recently...




I have owned my P85 for nearly two years, and am eagerly awaiting delivery of a new P85D. I am a rabid Telsa fan and shareholder. Given an opportunity, I'm not shy about telling everyone that my experience with my Tesla tells me that electric cars are the future; because they’re just clearly superior vehicles in almost all ways.

Except for long trips. Personally I have never driven my S on a trip over 200 miles. In fact, in my two years of ownership I've almost never charged anywhere other than my garage. For almost all of my daily needs I have no need to charge except at night. But, if I'm going somewhere where my potential distance is anywhere close to my maximum range, I take my ICE. Why? I don't want the inconvenience of potentially having to ""seek out"" a place to charge.

1217,Battery Pack Predictions,361,"Nov 23, 2014","Following the release of the ""D"", I was surprised that the ""something else"" wasn't a larger pack. 

This could hint that Tesla may make more significant increases less often than a small change more frequently. 

The super charger network is making range possible and practical for those willing to add 1hr for every 150-200 miles driven.

Once you get to 300 miles ""easy"" range most people (excluding hardcore long range drivers) would be ready for a break anyway. 

I doubt we'll see a 95-100kWh pack, instead we'll get a much larger jump - perhaps 125-165kWh range.

A few things to add to what everyone else has already said.

The LEAF feels bigger then a Model S. So I parked them up next to each other and took this photo.





Of course the MS is much larger. But it you don't feel it behind the wheel or in the front seat. Debbie didn't like sitting in the back of the MS. Dunno if she has ever sat in the back of our LEAF.


Very nice to drive. Like any stupid powerful RWD car, you can get the rear end to loose traction if you apply too much power. Tesla's traction control felt reactive rather than proactive. The LEAF is more on the proactive side robbing the car of power for a couple of seconds. Tesla waits until the car is just over the edge and then cuts in. It reminds me of driving a big engine BMW in sport mode.


Overall they've done a very good job of hiding the car's mass. Impressive. The test car seemed to be well put together. It had just over 10,000 miles on it. The tires looked like the car had been cornered hard more then a few times. I didn't notice any uneven panel gaps or other minor flaws I've seen a few people mention.


I can see the size being an issue for parking. ""Threading the needle"" on a narrow road with a MS didn't cause either of us much trouble.

It was good to know: yes, they do have comprehensive roadster training and knowledge is handed down and yes, they do have comprehensive workshop manuals, but ""no they would be hard to get outside Tesla"" .. I did ask 

Incidentally within the last 2 weeks they had done a roadster battery repair, with at least a new sheet, and the cost was under £1000, this, and all I saw left me with a very good impression - Tesla are Motoring !

1229,Predictions for Tesla's next battery and range,987,"Nov 7, 2014","My predictions are as follows:

New Battery Size: 105 kWh
Release Date: Aug 2016
EPA Range:
367 miles Model S105D
357 miles Model S105 & P105D
334 miles Model X105
300 miles Model S85D
290 miles Model S85 & P85D
272 miles Model X85

Let me explain how I came up with these numbers.

1. New Battery Sizes

The next gen battery size is mostly determined by yearly improvements in lithium ion battery technology. The idea is to replace existing cells with new cells and have more capacity without weight or price increase. There are skeptics who think lithium-ion batteries don't improve much or they improve very slowly. Therefore I want to give a few sources about this.

Marc Tarpenning is one of Tesla's co founders. They built the company on the idea that lithium-ion batteries improve constantly. In this presentation from 30:06 to 32:20 Tarpenning talks about battery improvements. If you switch to HD you can see a chart that shows 7.5% improvement per year. If we accept this percentage, year by year capacity improvements would be as follows:

2012: 85.00 kWh
2013: 91.38 kWh
2014: 98.23 kWh
2015: 105.60 kWh
2016: 113.51 kWh
2017: 122.03 kWh
2018: 131.18 kWh
2019: 141.02 kWh

Nov 2012. Elon Musk talked about yearly improvements to battery technology too. Watch from 40:00 to 40:45. LINK He said: ... lithium-ion batteries continue to improve. Roughly, on average, maybe 8% or 9% per year. Which, when compounded over several years, ends up being a meaningful improvement.

Feb 2014, Oslo. Elon said the following: ""There is potential for bigger battery packs in the future but it will probably be maybe next year or something like that."" 7:10s: LINK.

May 2014. JB Straubel talked about this as well. Watch from 5:19 to 8:15 LINK He said:

6:50s ""We looked at this graph and spent a lot of time talking to all the different companies driving the improvements here and there was nothing and still is nothing today that's clearly starting to plateau on this graph. These improvements are still compounding and improving and it's not a Moore's law, it's not close to that but it's something close to doubling in performance, of energy density performance about every 10 years.""

7:29s ""Model S was introduced about 5 years after the Roadster and we saw improvements around 40 percent. These improvements are not standing still. We are continuing to watch the same doubling every 10 years for at least another 10 to 20 years.""

Jun 2014. Annual Shareholder Meeting. Elon said the following:
Elon Musk (3 Jun 2014): ""You should expect to see a steady increase in range, the available range in the cars over time."" (Source 1:06:31 to 1:07:28)

Jul 2014. Panasonic published a PDF file with the following information:










Quote: ""Joint development with Tesla Motors is also presently underway for next-generation EV lithium-ion battery cells.""

Source 1 (web page), Source 2 (PDF file page 51)

Then at the end of the same month on 31st July 2014, Tesla had a conference call with the media. This is what JB Straubel and Elon said:

25:23 Journalist: On the Gigafactory, is the chemistry going to be the same battery chemistry that you're currently using or is that part of the discussions that are going on with Panasonic?
25:34 Elon Musk: There are improvements to the chemistry, as well as improvements to the geometry of the cell. So we would expect to see an energy density improvement and of course a significant cost improvement. JB, do you want to add anything?
25:53 JB Straubel: Yeah, that's right. The cathode and anode materials themselves are next generation. We're seeing improvements in the maybe 10% to 15% range on the chemistry itself.
26:09 Elon Musk:Yeah, in terms of energy density.
26:09 JB Straubel: Energy density. And then we're also customizing the cell shape and size to further improve the cost efficiency of the cell and our packaging efficiency.
26:22 Elon Musk: Right. We've done a lot of modeling trying to figure out what's the optimal cell size. And it's really not much. It's not a lot different from where we are right now but we're sort of in the roughly 10% more diameter, maybe 10% more height. But then the cubic function effectively ends up being just from a geometry standpoint probably a third more energy for the cell or maybe 30%. And then the actual energy density per unit mass increases.
27:09 JB Straubel: Yeah. Fundamentally the chemistry of what's inside is what really defines the cost position. It's often debated what shape and size, but at this point we're developing basically what we feel is the optimum shape and size for the best cost efficiency for an automotive cell.
27:25 Elon Musk:Yeah.
27:28 Journalist: The chemical formula will be the same, it's just shaped differently or?
27:32 Elon Musk: No.
27:32 JB Straubel:No.
27:35 Journalist: Is it a different formula?
27:37 Elon Musk: Yeah.

10 Oct 2014, SoCal Energy Summit. JB Straubel used the following image in his presentation.










24 Oct 2014. Elon Musk said ""For a cell that doesn't have lots of other drawbacks we are at roughly 300 Wh/kg"" 38m 05s: LINK. According this article from 27 Feb 2012 ""Model S batteries should weigh in at around 240 Wh/kg"" Source: LINK. In other words 1 kilogram of battery cells used to store 0.24 kWh energy but now it stores 0.3 kWh. This means the cells in the 85 kWh battery (not the pack itself but just the cells) weigh 85/0.24= 354kg. The new cells that have the same 354kg weight and 300Wh/kg energy density would have the capacity of 354*300= 106.2 kWh. Therefore I expect the new battery size to be 105 kWh.

 2. EPA Range
Range per kWh for the Model S is a good criteria to look at.

60 kWh Model S has 208 miles EPA range. 208/60= 3.47 mi/kWh
85 kWh Model S has 265 miles EPA range. 265/85= 3.12 mi/kWh

However the EPA ratings haven't been updated since Jul 2012 when they were announced but the car has improved. The current Model S85 would receive higher EPA scores if it was tested today. I wrote about this in another topic here in case you want to read more. The current numbers should be as follows:

60 kWh Model S has 215 miles expected EPA range. 215/60= 3.58 mi/kWh
85 kWh Model S has 289 miles expected EPA range. 289/85= 3.40 mi/kWh

Why does the S85 have worse miles per kWh score than the S60? Because it is heavier. The reason it is heaver is because the battery has more cells. The next gen battery would have the same number of cells (7104 cells) as the S85 because we are replacing existing cells with new cells that weight the same. Therefore it would get 3.4 mi/kWh too.

3.4*105= 357 miles EPA range for S105. 367 miles EPA for S105D. In that topic you can also see that I estimated the S85D EPA rating to be 299 but now I expect Tesla to achieve 300 to get the extra ZEV credits.Model X is expected to have 91% range of dual motor Model S. That would be 0.91*367= 335 miles. S85 would be 0.91*299= 272. Putting all these together we get the list I wrote at the beginning of this message.

3. Release Date

Tesla will start losing money on ZEV credits in 2015 because they don't qualify for the maximum credit points per car. To get the maximum points they need to meet these two criteria:

1. 300 mile EPA rated range
2. Battery swap stations

These criteria are mentioned in section 1962.1(d)(5)(B) on page 13 in these regulations PDF LINK. At the end of page 13 and beginning of page 14 it says: ""Examples of fast refueling events include ... swapping of the depleted battery"". The 300 mile rule is valid for 2015, 2016 and 2017. This means Tesla doesn't want to delay upgrading the battery too much because they would lose money on ZEV credits. Therefore it would make sense to do the battery upgrade sooner than later even though there is no other car company challenging Tesla.

There is already construction work going on at Harris Ranch battery swap station: LINK1, LINK2. Gigafactory starts production in 2016 and it will make next gen cells which is now confirmed by both Panasonic and Tesla. Isn't 2016 a little too late for ZEV credits? It is but Tesla can do a soft upgrade to range without upgrading the battery. Improvements in power electronics and reduction in weight is likely to bring S85D EPA range to 300. The EPA range for S85D is not announced yet but it is expected soon. The new EPA range for S85 should also improve from 265 to 289. All this is consistent with latest range data available on the order page since 10 Oct 2014.

When the Gigafactory starts production, Tesla will continue importing cells from Japan. Then cells from both sources will be made into packs at the Gigafactory. This means next gen cells will come from Japan too. Technically it should be possible to switch to next gen cells before the Gigafactory. However releasing the 105 kWh early in 2016 is not a good time because Model X buyers would be upset if their car was outdated a few months after they received it after waiting for years. Therefore it makes sense to wait until the Gigafactory which I expect to start production in Aug 2016.

5 November 2014. Elon said Source

17:28: With respect to the cathode materials, there is a lot of technology improvements that we will be able to apply to the battery pack and the cathode, anode, separator, can production, the whole works. Some of these improvements are independent to others.

17:50: Whatever we build out for the Gigafactory has to work at least at the lab level, let's say this year because we are making monster investments in equipment and there is a certain amount of time, a year or two at least from working at the lab level to working at small scale production. Then at least a year or two after that you can go from small scale production to mass production.

To me this sounds like Elon is saying the new battery is ready now at lab level but they can't do mass production in 2015 because it needs more time.

On 7 Nov 2014, Tesla 10-Q Securities and Exchange Commission report had the following information: Source (Page 26)









Quote: Construction continued during the third quarter of 2014 at an accelerated pace with first cells expected to be produced in 2016 for use in Model S and Model X. We plan to use the battery packs manufactured at the Gigafactory for our vehicles, initially for Model S and Model X, and later for our Model 3 vehicle, and stationary storage applications. 

This means we know that the Gigafactory will make next gen cells and we also know it will start production in 2016 and additionally we know that those cells will be used in Model S and X. That is the reason for my 2016 prediction for the next gen battery pack.",4.0,3,2512

Radio Program About NUMMI Factory, 2010, 61m, LINK (Click on the small arrow under the picture. There is a 23 second radio advert before it starts)
This is a sad story about Toyota and GM's Nummi Factory. Today that building is Tesla's Fremont Factory where they build the cars. Tesla bought it from Toyota. It had a capacity of 500.000 cars per year. Elon Musk said in the future Tesla will restore the factory to its former capacity.
In September 2014 during his Japan trip Elon said they have a lot of things to learn from Toyota. This radio program provides some background on why Elon said that. It gives a glance into a fascinating piece of history where two companies with very different cultures, Toyota and GM collided with each other. Maybe it also gives us some clues where Tesla could go and what kind of company they could become.

Who Killed the Electric Car? (2006, 92m, Documentary, Moreflicks**)
SEARCH LINK (select 92 minutes long video)








Elon Musk talked about this documentary many times (link1, link2). He said when GM made the EV1 he thought they would continue with EV2, EV3. But when they crushed the EV1 that's when he knew electric cars wouldn't succeed without a new car company. In other interviews Elon said his motivation is to take a sad thing and change it into a positive. This documentary gives us an idea on the background why Tesla Motors was started.
The director of this documentary, Chris Paine, also directed the documentary 'Revenge of the Electric Car' (listed above) a few years after this. Here is a 49m interview with him about his two documentaries where he also talks about Tesla and Elon Musk among other things.

Notes:
 1. Anybody can copy this list and create their own version on another website without giving credit to me.
2. This list respects copyrights. All direct links open to the original video uploaded by the copyright holder.
3. Most dates shown here are recording date, not upload date. It makes more sense to sort videos by recording date if somebody wants to watch them in historical context. Sometimes the recording date that you see here, is not mentioned anywhere on the video page and you might be wondering where the recording date came from. I came from Google search for the date of that specific event.
4. This content is directly or indirectly related to Tesla. There is another list here for general EV content but it doesn't follow the two criteria I mentioned above.
5. I applied two criteria when creating this list. (1) All items are accessible online to create a better experience. That means if there was a Tesla documentary that you couldn't watch online, I wouldn't list it here because it would create a bad experience. (2) All videos are over 20 minutes, other than a few exceptions, to make them worthwhile watching.
6. If I stop updating the list, moderators are welcome to update links and to add items (but not to remove) that meet the two criteria at the beginning.

1244,Tesla's random release dates are disappointing,987,"Oct 11, 2014","On 9 October 2014 Tesla announced the D version Model S with dual motor AWD. But some people who recently bought a Tesla are not happy about it (*). In some cases these customers haven't even received their car yet and can not change their order because confirmed orders can't be changed.

I think the main problem with random release dates is that you don't know these dates therefore you can't make the decisions. The control of the decision making is taken from the customer. Tesla doesn't to follow the yearly release model all other car makers use because Tesla innovates faster. I think therefore the solution would be to have two or three fixed release dates per year.

For example if two release dates are enough then January 1 and July 1 could be selected as release dates. This way customers can decide whether to wait for the next release or not. If two per year is not frequent enough for Tesla then they could announce a new model every 4 months. But the dates must be fixed and not random.

With fixed release dates the customers make the decisions. The customer will own the decision. If he decides not to wait he will blame himself. With random dates customers are blaming Tesla and rightly so for having missed out on new features.

1253,Tesla's misleading battery warranty,987,"Sep 14, 2014","Hi,

There are two different aspects to this topic:

1. The misleading advertisement aspect of Tesla's infinite mile battery warranty and whether it gives the impression that it covers degradation

2. Whether Tesla should offer battery degradation warranty like Nissan.

This thread is about the first aspect.

I think it is unacceptable for Tesla to brag about infinite miles warranty when they lag behind Nissan and BMW on battery degradation cover (link). The public should know about that. Tesla isn't always right and doesn't always do the right thing for the EV community.

The BBC radio program Kevin participated (link) and similar publicity seems to be good way to encourage Tesla to do the right thing after they have been so stubborn for long time. More media coverage will eventually bring up the issue to the attention of higher management at Tesla.

I want EVs to succeed and I was concerned about the degradation issue. On their website Tesla advertises ""unlimited miles battery warranty"" for the Model S but they don't mention on the sales page that degradation is not covered. I find that misleading.

At the end of April 2014 I contacted Advertising Standards Authority and received the response below after two weeks. They didn't agree with me. But I still think it is misleading to hide the fine print about degradation and advertise some misleading statement like unlimited miles battery warranty on the sales page when that doesn't mean anything. I explained to ASA that theoretically the battery could degrade to only 1 mile range but still wouldn't require replacement under the warranty however the statement on the order page doesn't give that impression at all. Tesla claims to do the right thing by the consumer but then hides the fine print in the warranty statement on a PDF file on the specs page of their US website. The PDF isn't available on their UK website.

The fact that degradation is not covered should be mentioned on the sales page right next to where unlimited mile warranty is mentioned. After all, they sell the cars on their UK version of their website with UK prices and VAT. They have a presence in the UK and therefore the advertising shouldn't be misleading according UK regulations. ASA didn't agree with me but I don't agree with their decision. Maybe if they receive more complaints they might change their mind.

ASA's response is below. Some of the arguments in their response which I underlined below are incorrect. There are many people who think Tesla's warranty includes degradation even after buying the Model S.





Your complaint: Tesla Motors Ltd

Thank you for contacting the Advertising Standards Authority. I’m sorry to learn this matter caused you concern.

You may already be aware that our role as an organisation is to assess the content of ads and consider whether they are likely to breach the UK Codes of Advertising on the basis suggested. We may consider there is likely to be a breach of Code if, for example, we deem the ad likely to materially mislead the majority of consumers, or cause serious or widespread offence or harm.

We have looked at the ad you refer to and considered it in terms of the UK Code of Non-broadcast Advertising, Sales Promotion and Direct Marketing (CAP). However, we did not consider that we have reasonable grounds to propose any further action on this occasion. I realise this may be disappointing, so I would like to take the time to detail the reason for our decision below, for your information.

I want to start by saying that I can appreciate your reason for objecting to the ad. However, we have to consider how the majority of consumers are likely to interpret the ad and whether they are likely to be misled. Whilst we noted that text stated “8 year, unlimited mile battery warranty”, we considered that consumers would be likely to understand that the ‘unlimited’ claim referred to mileage accumulated over 8 years rather than the scope of the warranty cover; no matter how many miles the car had done over 8 years, the battery would be still be covered under the warranty. Whilst I can understand your concerns with regard to the exclusion of battery degradation in the warranty, we understood that this was a common practice, and considered that consumers would be likely to understand that general wear and tear would not be covered by the warranty. As such, we did not consider that this condition contradicted the claim, and concluded that the ad was unlikely to mislead consumers. In the absence of an apparent breach of Code, we do not propose any further action on this occasion.

I understand that this may not have been the outcome you were hoping for, but I would like to thank you nonetheless for taking the time and trouble to raise your concerns with us.

Yours sincerely,

I'm also still missing my V5, and the physical plates. Which were supposedly posted over a week ago. My semi-educated guess is whoever has a registration ending FKO, is probably in possession of those now...

I would like to contribute to the Android OVMS app by supplying some widgets.
I'm thinking of making widgets like:

VDS-style temperature bars:
- PEM
- Motor
- Battery

Battery load/capacity bar
Current speed
Ideal range
Estimated range

That way people can monitor the car from their phone's start screen, or even from their SmartWatch if needed.

I started working on the Widget first. The ""intelligence"" behind this will come as soon as I have my OVMS installed in the car. In the mean time, I'm killing some spare time designing this widget.
Here's version 0.001 in Zooper Widget, based on the VDS design. It's using phone battery data to try this out:











More to come!
Feel free to post some ideas and let me know what you think!


Todo list:
- Have Tasker get information from openvehicles website and update widget.
- Improve widget design
- Show charging status
- Different widget sizes
- Different widget designs (minimalistic, colorful, Tesla-like etc).
- Additional widget for current speed
- Sony Smartwatch SW2 Support


Update: All the neccesary graphs and data are in place. Tonight I will install my OVMS, and tomorrow I will try to get the data to the widgets. If this is succesful, I will release the first beta version of this widget so people here can start testing it.

I pointed out that I was almost done and will be leaving in a few minutes. Then I was subjected to a tirade of abuse including ""these are for leaf owners"", ""people like you can afford to charge elsewhere"", ""your not allowed to use these, Ecotricity are taking Tesla to court"", plus a few more more fragrant responses that I wont reproduce here.

Now I am 6 foot 1 built like a rugby prop so know I can be intimidating but luckily I have a mild temperament and don't easily reach the point where I punch idiots on the nose, however this person came very close to putting me in a position that I really want to be.

So I made if very clear to him that the chargers were for all EV drivers and if he had been reasonable I would have unplugged immediately and let him use it, however as it happens I turned on my heals and went back to get in line at Costa for another coffee.

Strangely enough when I came out 10 minutes later he had gone, so either he was not really that desperate for the charge or something else caused the outburst, either way I hope this is a one off otherwise things are going to get ugly.

After the event we all walked back and as I was putting my camera away a small crowd came up to ask about the car. Usual stuff, how many miles, how long to charge etc etc

However one middle to elder gentleman seemed to get rather irate, when i said it costs around £5 to charge from flat on cheap rate electricity, he just blurted out ""rubbish"", then when I said it will go between 250 and 270 miles on a charge, again ""impossible"", he said there must be an engine hidden in there somewhere, even after I opened the bonnet and boot.

Tesla are promising new improved seats for the model S next year that are retrofittable, hopefully this is a sign that every 5-10 years you can just upgrade your existing car to the latest tech.

1274,Picked up my car yesterday,404,"Jul 20, 2014","Wow, I am totally in love with a car, an American car no less!

We traveled down to that there London yesterday morning and picked up our black S85 and, after a brief hand-over, we were off. In order to travel the 220 miles back to the Wirral, we took it easy at around 60-65 mph up the M40, M42, M6 toll, M6 and then across country along the A500 and up through to Chester and the M53. We wanted to try to make it in one hop but also decided to stop for food and try out the chargers.

First impressions? This is one very amazing car. It does not feel too big (although parking takes a little getting used to, what with a reverse camera, parking sensors and the mk 1 eyeball using the wing mirrors, it's confusing where to look!), it is a comfortable cruiser and an absolute bruiser at any speed ;-) Actually, the best fun is to be had accelerating from 30/40 mph onto the motorway, phenomenal linear application of huge power. At 70 mph and wanting to overtake? Well, it's a license-loser if you're not careful; 105mph in the blink of an eye (luckily my wife kept her eye on the speedo while I kept my eye on the road!)

Handling is surprisingly good and the seats very comfortable (no problem with a 4.5 hr drive). 

The car gets a lot of attention, from van drivers giving the thumbs up (not sure why) to strangers engaging in the ""what is it?"" conversation wherever you are parked.

As to charging; we decided to test the Ecotricity chargers and stopped first at Warwick (N). Both spaces at the DC/AC unit were empty but I could not get the car and charger to communicate. I suspect it may be because I plugged in before going though the process steps? Anyway, we gave up after a few minutes and drove on further to Keele, where the DC/AC unit was out-of-action but the older 22kW unit worked fine with our Tesla-supplied type 2 cable; charging at 22kW gave as about 60 mph. This latter unit is obviously well suited to the Tesla as it's limited to 22kW AC, until we get the CHAdeMO adapter, of course (and the superchargers which, when the network is complete, means there will be no need for a Tesla to use the Ecotricity network at all). 

The parking space at Warwick was very tight while at Keele, the bays were huge.

Last night we went to a Brazilian festival in Liverpool and onto a local pub where everyone delighted in ""honking my horn"" on the Tesla app. on my 'phone (I'm not sure my neighbours would be as delighted) and I think I've made at least one sale for Tesla (to a local actress) and added much more interest in EV's in general.

Today, as my brother is visiting from Manchester (to see the car would you believe!), instead of the local restaurants in the village for Sunday dinner, we decided to try the Anchor in Irby; an excellent pub/restaurant by the way, just so we could use the car. Everyone well impressed when I said ""navigate to the Anchor, Irby"" and the satnav duly set up the route, it even understands my hybrid Welsh/Scouse accent!

And this is where it gets interesting (and where I stop caring about the parking ticket and start caring about principles): Norway has a Personal Data Protection Act, which dictates that if a company is saving data about you, they not only have to tell you what they save, but you also have a “right of inspection” (something I confirmed with a quick call to the Norwegian Data Protection Authority). Furthermore, I am vice chairman of Digitalt Personvern, an association working to repeal the EU data retention directive and know some of the best data privacy lawyers in Norway.

So I can probably set in motion a campaign to force Tesla Norway to give me access to my data, based on Norwegian law. Tesla’s policies may be American, but their Norwegian subsidiary has to obey Norwegian laws.

Musk was careful to avoid saying anything else, moving swiftly on to other questions, but we’re curious as to what exactly he meant by “controversial.” One possibility is that Musk will release Tesla Supercharger patents, allowing other automakers and infrastructure providers to adopt Tesla’s ultra-fast 130 kilowatt supercharger technology in order to make rapid charging of longer-range electric cars quick and easy.

""We could definitely make a flying car – but that's not the hard part. The hard part is, how do you make a flying car that's super safe and quiet?

That moves the fast-growing company well ahead of Toyota Motor Corp.

This morning in Hamilton, New Jersey, we cut the ribbon on our 100th Supercharger station. A crowd of more than 100 people, including New Jersey state legislators, Tesla executives, and supporters, marked the milestone moment in the sunshine at the location next to a popular shopping center.

“What a great turn out!”, New Jersey Assemblyman Timothy Eustace told the crowd of more than 100 people. “We are zealots for electric cars, and we welcome and thank you for being here.”

James Chen, Tesla’s Vice President of Regulatory Affairs, said that electric vehicles and Superchargers are about alleviating the world’s addiction to oil. “What we are really doing here today is getting to our core mission of catalyzing the electric vehicle industry,” Chen said.

At a Supercharger, a Model S can get half a charge in as little as 20 minutes, allowing for long-distance travel without having to pay a cent for gas (or, now that we mention it, electricity). By charging only at Superchargers, Model S owners can drive for free, forever.

1317,"The future of “Made in America” is Tesla, not Ford",37,"Apr 14, 2014","Ford’s F-150 pickup truck is about as American as a vehicle can get.

Not only has the iconic truck been the country’s top-selling vehicle for 32 straight years (and the top-selling truck for 37); they are also the most American-made. The giant F150 topped cars.com’s American-Made index last year, which measures where parts come from, where the car is assembled, and sales.

But that could soon change. According to Morgan Stanley, Tesla vehicles could soon claim the top spot on that list, once the company’s much-vaunted $6-billion gigafactory to produce its own lithium-ion batteries is up and running.

By then, more than 90% of the stuff used to build Tesla’s cars might be from America, according to Morgan Stanley, compared to 75% for the F-150.

Tesla has defied its doubters (especially among petrolheads) with the success of the Model S, a smartly styled luxury saloon. It may not share the outrageous looks of a supercar like the Lamborghini Aventador, but it has the performance without the $400,000-plus price tag. The most basic Model S costs $64,000 in America (after subsidies). This has won it rave reviews in the motoring press, often sniffy about other electric cars with limited ranges and duff looks. By designing a large car with a big battery pack, Tesla has diminished “range anxiety”—one version can do 310 miles (500km) between charges.

1338,"Elon Musk posts about Tesla, Model S fires, the media...",1,"Nov 19, 2013","This is a very rigorous, balanced and thorough blog post by Elon Musk, in part as a rebuttal to the media response to three recent Tesla Model S fires. It's a good read, but in particular interest to current and future Tesla owners is the section titled ""Further Actions"", where an interesting and unique warranty offer is made.

I'll link to the full post below, but I think these few paragraphs offer a decent insight...




Since the Model S went into production last year, there have been more than a quarter million gasoline car fires in the United States alone, resulting in over 400 deaths and approximately 1,200 serious injuries (extrapolating 2012 NFPA data). However, the three Model S fires, which only occurred after very high-speed collisions and caused no serious injuries or deaths, received more national headlines than all 250,000+ gasoline fires combined. The media coverage of Model S fires vs. gasoline car fires is disproportionate by several orders of magnitude, despite the latter actually being far more deadly.

Reading the headlines, it is therefore easy to assume that the Tesla Model S and perhaps electric cars in general have a greater propensity to catch fire than gasoline cars when nothing could be further from the truth.

Journalists with a deep knowledge of the car industry, such as the news editor of Automotive News, understand and attempt to rebut this notion, but they have been drowned out by an onslaught of popular and financial media seeking to make a sensation out of something that a simple Google search would reveal to be false. I would also like to express appreciation for the investigative journalists who took the time to research and write an accurate article.

Amazingly, Tesla'a warranty will now cover fire damage in all incidents, ""even if due to driver error""...




Third, to reinforce how strongly we feel about the low risk of fire in our cars, we will be amending our warranty policy to cover damage due to a fire, even if due to driver error. Unless a Model S owner actively tries to destroy the car, they are covered. Our goal here is to eliminate any concern about the cost of such an event and ensure that over time the Model S has the lowest insurance cost of any car at our price point. Either our belief in the safety of our car is correct and this is a minor cost or we are wrong, in which case the right thing is for Tesla to bear the cost rather than the car buyer.
