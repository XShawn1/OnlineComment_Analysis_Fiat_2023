## Acknowledgement
The research project within this repo was conducted by Chuqiao Xiao, which is based on one of the working branches of the Bayes (Cass) Business School MSc Business Analytics 2023 graduation group project by Chuqiao Xiao
## Data Source
SpeakEV - an online forum for EV (electric vehicle) enthusiasts
## Research Objectives & Approaches
The project aims to understand how online customer perceptions on EV topics evolve over time. The focus of the project is to compare how customer perceptions differ before & after an EV model was launched.

- In the 1st phase the online comments were scrapped by Python; 

- In the 2nd phase the NLP technologies were applied to process data then output the model results; 

- In the 3rd phase the results were visulaised through both Python and PowerBI; 

- In the last phase the results & visualisations were analysed and insights were concluded

**Scrapping packages used**: Selenium, BeautifulSoup

**NLP technologies & packages used**: Text Preprocessing - SpaCy, Topic Modelling - Gensim, Sentiment Analysis - Transformers (models from Hugging Face)

**BI tools**: Matplotlib, PowerBI
## Research Objects (Brands)
Online discussions regarding EVs by Fiat, Peugeot, Tesla, Mini, Volkswagen
## Research Results
- It’s recognised that customers are focusing more on EV features (e.g., battery, driving range, charging facilities) in recent years and can be sensitive to EV prices.
- Some brands’ strategies on developing intelligent systems can intrigue customers’ interests.
- Customer perceptions on some granular EV features remain unclear.
