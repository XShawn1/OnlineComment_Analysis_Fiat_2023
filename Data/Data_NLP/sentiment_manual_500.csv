6,=,"My nine year old Nissan Note is getting old and will need to be replaced around 2025/2026, this could be just the car. It is just a bit shorter than the Note and it has a lot of space for putting things, such as my cats' huge cat basket. It will have to compete with other contenders such as the Tesla 2 and electric Nissan Micra. One of the main issues will be range, 250 miles and above would be practical."

13,-,This would be my perfect car if the interior wasn't so stupid. Vw needs to go back a generation with their interiors. The software they use currently is so bad
14,-,"Really forward thinking. As a start, VW, bring the ID.3 to the US....the ID.4 is too family oriented for younger drivers. We need more fun cars. ID2/3 GTI?"
15,=,So 4 of them would be as powerful as a Bugatti ?

23,=,"Tesla is asking for duty exemption for its cars. If government allows that than other brands will also ask the govt for exemption. We are already having Tata motors and Hyundai, which are manufacturing their electric vehicles. Now Tesla demands royal treatment for themselves which can not be done. Even Mercedes announced its EVs assembly in India. Are they unaware of Indian market."
24,-,"Sell it or use it as a local city use car, and not a road trip car. And only charge it at home

Kind of ironic, what's the use if an off road vehicle when using it out in the middle of nowhere leaves u stranded cause chargers and to be trusted and relied upon

Clearly non tesla cars didn't think of all this and just assumed everyone will charge at home

Or just petition tesla to offer non tesla cars charging for a 100$ per month subscription that doesn't include cost of charging

If tesla does that their stock will go to the moon

Bro with a gas off road vehicle u can carry extra Jerry cans of gas, you can go to a gas station anywhere u like, fill up in 2 minutes. This entire vehicle is useless for its intended purpose

And get a towing subscription service that's nation wide with alot of miles for free included so if any of u cars need a tow it's free bud"

29,-,"While I love Tesla, fully electric vehicles have no place in Europe due to weather. We could see as an example over last few weeks we had a little bit of frost here in the UK and the disasster happened. All of the sudden the range of all EVs dropped by 75% due to cold weather. With the range of 65 miles when fully charged, your chance of getting to work are very slim."
30,+,"kinda like vtec with the larger cam-lobes at higher rpm.... but look at nissans VVEL system first tested and proven on the 370z for the intake valve train where electronic actuators continuously adjust valve lift(how much the valve opens), nissan used it later on the 5.6 v8 in the QX56 also and that system is now in the new TITAN v8 on the intake and exhaust valve trains giving it more power and fuel efficiency...."
31,-,VW Never sold a pick up in the US? You need to do more research prior to making videos.

40,=,Good review but with all these reviews no price is never mentioned.
41,+,2 years you will be waiting for one
42,-,Too bad french car brands are as reliable as a wet tissue and their value is demolished after a short time.
43,-,Has anyone seen stopping distances for any of the ID cars? I notice the story being repeated about engine braking meaning the drum brakes on the rear are fine but unlike other cars no-one seems to be testing that claim? Drum brakes are known to suffer badly from fade with more spirited use.
44,+,Intro music is ðŸ‘Œ marek thanks made my friday much easier..
45,-,"It sounds like VW (unlike Ford or GM) realizes that once Tesla releases their ~25k USD car, it will be even be harder to catch up with Tesla in North America. In fact, if a Tesla small EV arrives soon to market in the US, and is well received, it very well could be a knock-out blow to several automakers competing in this space. VW competes in this space in NA, so smart of them to go hard this way now. It is inevitable, they will have to go this direction in the future anyhow, or VW will receive a knockout blow in NA."
46,=,Where is the handbrake?
47,+,"This is cool and in the right spec. A possible alteration may be a fiat 500 e-conversion with no gearbox (Gear lever) and a central driving position. ðŸ¤ª

Q. The gearbox in the video looks new. Is this an original part or did you install a newer gearbox which could handle the increase in power?

Love these videos."
48,-,Hate when people do this shit!
49,=,Upgraded to a 2 bbl carb I see

52,=,I'll stick with my MG5.  Â£19500 after discounts and real world range averaging at 200 miles.
53,=,Wait how many balls tho
54,=,So you're just gonna slouch over in the back and then just speak about leg room and not head room? ðŸ¤”.  Ahm. Hmm
55,+,"Imagine this same size vehicle.  Take all the junk in the front and move it to the back.   Now have a more vertical window in front and move the seats forward.   How much more seating space would you have?   No it would not be a VW van as this is still much smaller, but far more useful.    Ah!, you say, aerodynamics would suffer!     True, but is the fiat meant for high speed long distance commutes?  Not in my opinion, it's a city car, at that speed you would see little difference in range."
56,+,This line-up is insane!! True dream stuff!!!
57,+,Competitors cost like 10k more.
58,=,Why has no one commented on Tesla NOT dropping the Prices in Australia to near Equal of other Markets supplied by China

61,=,"25.000 â‚¬ with 250Km range, 16 inches steel rims, 7inch primary display and partial led lights? ðŸ¤­"
62,-,This video is a perfect example as to why fully electric vehicles are not the way of the future and STILL people will try to defend these less effective cars.
63,-,So let me get this straight. These shitty little EVs that can only be driven very slowly cost almost as much as a Honda Civic Type-R or Toyota Yaris GR???? And that is even after taxpayers' money has been swindled for the EV subsidy?
64,-,That pinched rubber door seal hurts to watch ðŸ¤£
65,+,We love our ID4. Wonderful ride. More comfortable than our model y which my wife might trade in to get the AWD because we have the rear wheel drive right now. The tech and interior work so well together. Forget what they say about too much screen and touch sensitive buttons. You get used to it in less than a week.

I love the looks of it but I think they missed an opportunity here.
They should have focused on bringing a budget sports EV that outperforms the ICE model in every performance metric. Looks like itâ€™s trying to be something itâ€™s not in the cabin.
I love abarth but at 38k you are competing with a different class of car, frankly one Iâ€™m uninterested in."

145,-,"I would have preferred a version of the Fiat 500 with the pointless back seats taken out to save weight, give more battery perhaps, or just increase luggage space. But as long as Fiat make a big stack of cash on this that offsets the cost of making other electric cars, I'm fine for people to soon be parted from their money. 

I'm not currently aware of a smaller car that's still expected to be made for the next few years and is available in Europe at scale. The Microlina is probably a quadricycle, as is the Ami and the Smart is a car but they're ceasing production if they haven't already. That leaves the Fiat 500 on my fantasy wishlist and maybe people who like it can pick up this massive downgrade in the future? Perhaps retrofit a better battery than either have currently?"

Seems counteractive but with leaving the valve open longer, your potentially pushing burnt exhaust gases into the intake causing buildup. They could use a very small lobe on the exhaust side (assuming roller lifters) to then push out some of that air during compression but that would be a complex cam profile.  Electric valving is still expensive and complex,  and with it not being on the market very long, who knows what it's weaknesses are. I suppose by pulling vacuum though would cancel itself in  the fact that it would just pull the piston back upward. Maybe try something similar to a ""Jake brake"" by lifting the exhaust valve open to expel some air before fuel is introduced (direct injection would be needed) but this could be useful in a towing type vehicle.

Some details: no crankshaft, no camshaft, no valves, 1/3 of weight of a conventional, ultra compact, more power, turning on all bio-fuel and hydrogen and that with the same block due to a sophisticated variable compression, and of course very eco-friendly at a low production and maintenance cost. Its name: the Barronex engine, suitable for motorcycles to vessels. The solution for hybrid cars.

426,=,"It looks more like a method of improving emissions to meet regulations than a method of improving efficiency.  By closing the intake valve early, the volumetric efficiency drops, thus less power is generated because less air gets sucked into the engine.  Since it compresses less air, compression pressures drop, giving it a similar effect to that of lowering compression ratio.  It is much like putting in a more mild camshaft in old-school terms. It didn't seem to help fuel economy figures when everyone did this back in the late 1970s."

434,+,As always a great honest review and interesting insight into electric car ownership. Thanks Ian and Miss Hubnut!  I like the idea of the 'Onto way' that you can rent the car on a month by month basis. IT gives potential owners the 'try before you buy' option. I'm a bit on the fence with electric cars. I love the clever engineering behind them but am concerned about their end of life recyclability as well as the fact their labelled emission free which they arnt really. One other concern is the battery life. A current petrol or diesel car is designed to have a life of say 10 to 15 years. Most EV's and hybrids seem to have battery issues within 10 years and when the battery needs replacing its a write off due to the fact the battery is basically the floorpan of the car. I have never been in a position to own a new car (i think the newest was 6 years old) due to the cost so if I decided to go electric then I run the risk of a battery towards the end of the cars life. Hopefully I will be proven wrong and future battery's will be more recyclable and last longer. I think electric cars have their place but are not the future. I think Hydrogen powered cars are the future using fuel cell power. ITs an exciting time to be an Automotive engineer that's for sure!!

Electric cars are not where they need to be in regards to charging times to be worth the price tag.
Besides, i live in a flat and i am not allowed install a charger, so i need to charge before i drive home or hope there is charge left in the morning so i can drive to a charger.
Oh and i would need to get up a few hours earlier befor work, just to go charge?
