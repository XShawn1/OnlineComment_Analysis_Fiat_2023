0,Fiat doesn't like transparency,112918,"Apr 4, 2023","I haven't seen my 500e yet although it stands at the dealership's basement for more than a month now. The car is already registered to my name and I paid the annual tax.
There has been a callback for the batch my car was part of. The dealer can't tell me why because Fiat wouldn't even disclose the exact problem to him.
All Fiat says is it'll send technicians to take care of the problem. If the technicians sent from Turin are currently touring Europe, all I'm left to do is wait.",17,1,888

I normally drive a Zoe but it's going off the road today, possibly for some time, for a repair. I've been offered a Fiat 500e as a replacement, It's possibly the 42kWh version, but I don't know if other sizes are available - the garage quoted a 160 mile range but the Fiat website says ""up to 199"".

I'm just wondering if there's any ""gotchas"" about having a different car temporarily, eg.

1. My wife does a 100 mile round trip commute at 60-70mph. Will the car need charged to get back home? At this time of yea our Zoe uses around 40kWh to make that journey.

2. Does the Fiat have standard (type 2) home charging? We have a Zappi at home.

27,Kids in the backseat,97138,"Mar 26, 2022","Hi all,

So I have a Kona and love it, the other half loves driving the Kona because of the electric, but doesnâ€™t want one as itâ€™s to big ðŸ˜… we were considering a Zoe (she has a Mazda 2 at the moment) but really like the style and quirkyness of the Fiat 500e!

Itâ€™ll be a 2nd car so itâ€™s not doing long journeys, but whatâ€™s the backseats like for kids? YouTube reviews seem a bit mixed with some people saying itâ€™s fine and others not. We have a 5 year old (in a high back booster) and a 12 year old, but realistically 90% of the time the 12 year old would be in the passenger seat and just the 5 year old in the back (there might be the rare occasion where one of them has a friend in the car as well but thatâ€™s a really specific circumstance not the norm). If it was all 4 of us weâ€™d be using my Kona, but for when the other half is doing school runs and the odd trip to town etc, whatâ€™s peoples thoughts on the 500e? Anyone here have kids and use the back seats? How do they find it

I do totally understand, the Zoe is going to be more practicalâ€¦ but the 500e is a characterful little car!

33,What charging cables come with the fiat 500e icon?,105197,"Feb 3, 2022","Hi there 

I have ordered a fiat 500e icon on lease which will come in march, i had ordered a 208 gt premium petrol but they have had a recall on the car and delivery will be god knows when and i need to make sure i had a car for when my current lease went back end of march to start/mid april.

So i took the plunge as i wanted a EV (i do not drive far tbh) and this car was really the only one i could afford at the time i ordered it about a week ago.....other cars have prices raised ALOT and alot of cars and petrol ones have 8 weeks delivery some i have seen 6 months wait lol.

Anyway for the time being i will not be getting a home charger as the prices of them are ridiculous, i am sure they are charging way way over the odds for them, 700-1200. there have been a few for 549 etc but these are with the grant off WHICH if i tried to order now would be too late anyway as they do not have slots for instillation before the grant ends and so id be paying full price....literally can not afford it, plus i am pretty sure we would need something upgraded with the main fuse too.

I plan on using public chargers, there is a pub near me that has a free 50kw charger long as you are in the pub, me and my friend meet once a month for fee and usually in there atleast 3 hrs talking so it should give decent range, and there are others locally that you pay for but still cheaper than petrol.

i do not mind using a granny cable at home for inbetween tbh.

anyway the question is what cables come with the car, as in the description it just stays ....Charging Cable - Mode 3 

would that be the 7kw one where you can either plug it into a home wall charger and public chargers that are 7kw, do you get the granny cable at all as i do not fancy paying Â£170 for one.

Looking at the website you get a wall box that is essentially a neater way to use a 3 pin plug ( not bad but not ideal) as our dumb Rolec charger is nearly 6 years old I'm thinking of upgrading however there isn't any costs cited and dealership doesn't have details. 

Has anyone enquired? I know 6 years ago my install cost me Â£249 after the grant. I assume it'll be far more today. Also my concern is whilst 'smart' is neat. Dumb also means the energy providers can't tax use (which Im assuming will be enviable) as it's invisible to them so reluctant to give the Rolec up.

47,Fiat 500e Convertible La Prima Test Drive/Review,7126,"Apr 24, 2021","How to make this review short. Fiat have a Winner on their hands!
I am in the process of looking for a replacement EV for my BMW i3 94Ah (33kW) Rex which has just gone 4 years old and now on 57,000 miles. I have been looking at and testing ideally long range EVs the past few days, as there are now a few about (Kona, Tesla M3, ID3 etc) but this car has caught my eye! I love a small car and the 500 shape has been around for a few years now. Invited to drive this and luckily for me the dealership here in South Wales had both coupe and convertible La Prima editions but only the convertible was ready for a test drive, which would not be my first choice,as the coupe has a lovely panoramic but non opening sunroof anyway. But also lucky as it was a stunningly beautiful sunny day today.
The design of this car is already a classic based as it is on the tiny original. Modernised and now even more smoothed off as an EV. Proportions almost perfect. What really has surprised me and my wife today was the solidity and cabin quality, style and use and mix of cabin materials though. In a Fiat small car at that. I am familiar with the Abarth 500 but this e version is a big step up quality wise. Really clear and colourful drivers display with plenty of available information and the central display large, clear and colourful in a horizontal format. But also highly responsive as a touch screen. Not laggy like a lot of touch screens. Another surprise. Wireless Apple Car Play (and Android Auto as far as I know) standard on this model. Not sure about other models in the range.
Lovely light coloured leather seat. Could be even more bolstered but still comfortable. Lovely to hold leather 2 spoke 2 tone steering wheel. Physical buttons on wheel to control menus on drives display. Rear mounted steering wheel push buttons to control entertainment volume and source etc. 
Nice and clearly marked push button dashboard mounted drive buttons for P,R,N,D. Proper physical ventilation buttons/switches above that! Praise be! Wireless charging mat for phones in between the 2 sections. Accommodated my iPhone 12 Pro Max no problem.USB socket on dash and in central storage cubby. Also deep storage under central armrest. Marketed as a 2+2 of course but very tight in the back seats. A 2+0!? For storage or for small children or short distance emergency passenger lifts only. The coupe seats fold flat 50:50 but did not check the convertible but boot very very small and no major under boot storage- just puncture repair and 3 pin charge cable space really. No frunk.

Now for the driving. Even more impressed. Again that feeling of solidity. Super smooth ride on dual carriageway. Can be firmish over broken tarmac but mainly due to the short wheelbase. Has a firmish edge to it but controlled/very well damped. Dealt with numeorus speed bumps with no crashing or thumping at all. Another surprise. Took them with ease smoothly and softly.
This car is FUN to drive. Really holds the road well. Fast, direct and responsive steering. Not much feel but par for the course nowadays. It has that thing called ""character!"". If it was a dog it would be a terrier! Have no idea how powerful it is but is fast enough. Not i3 fast but fun and fast enough. Accelerates with ease, and passes other traffic easily. Typical of an EV.

And then there is the roof on the convertible. Certainly aware of more wind noise above your head when closed (Would like to compare with the coupe at some point). Individual ceiling mounted buttons to open - in 2 stages. Seems to open and close at any speed. We did at 40+mph. Not sure if there is a speed limit on its function. 1st press opens to a very large sunroof. 2nd press of same button folds canvas roof to back of car. Obscures rear vision mostly in that position. With windows open it does give the full convertible feel even though roof rails/structure still up and in place. Would have been nice to have some sort on inner sun mesh screen but I guess this would have been impossible design wise, as sun was blinding and harsh feeling on top of our heads at 2pm this afternoon. It is the only new convertible EV available as far as I know, so worth it! (excluding original and forthcoming Tesla roadster)
3 drive modes activated by a lever type switch between the seats. Normal, Range and Sherpa. Range does give you some re-gen effect which is very welcome but not 1 pedal driving as far as I could tell. Was having too much fun to test that.
Did not drive economically. Could you tell? Re-set dash trip meter at beginning and set to efficiency page. Covered 15 miles which included a mountain. Started on 83%. Back to dealership with 72%. 40 min drive but at least 10 mins fiddling with info screens and setting seats and mirrors etc. Average consumption 15.0kWh/100km. Not familiar with that combination of units but google seems to suggest 4.14mi/kWh. Warm day-16-18 degC/dry. Impressed with that as had it on Normal mode for most of drive. I think this has a 45kWh battery but as is often the way I am not sure if that is gross or net. Either way this is an impressive car. If we say it has a 40kWh battery then 150-160 mile real world range. I think Fiat have quoted a WLTP range of up to 199 miles? Driven more sedately nearer 200 miles should be possible but this is a type of car that does not necessarily encourage that!
Will hopefully get to try the coupe at some point. I gather they charge at 85kW. Once the charging infrastructure improves (I have been saying the same thing every year!), then it will be a no brainer to buy and run one of these. (Perceived) High quality little car. Small battery but big enough for urban trips and fast enough charging to do a longish trip. With the convertible roof it makes any trip an event. Especially on a sunny day. Would be good to try it in heavy rain. Noise? Insulation from the elements? Leaks? Perhaps present 500 convertible owners can advise.
Anyway this is a very welcome addition to the EV market, which is expanding almost daily at present. Fiat has definitely got its **** back. Or hit the EV target with this one. 
And they were offering discounts and good finance deals back at the dealership. APR was 5.?% 

As I have ended another review of a car I tested this week, on another part of the forum: this is my opinion of the car I test drove. Your opinion may differ. This is to inform people who may be interested in this car but unable to sample one for themselves at this time. Look forward to other reviews from you all at some point!",17,5,6932
48,500e Test Drive,13593,"Apr 24, 2021","After being interested in the 500e for quite a while, I was finally able to have a test drive last week at my local Fiat garage. Looks like I was the first to try it, as it only had 8 miles on the clock!

In general the car is a real quantum leap over the old 500. I always loved the look of the old 500, and actually bought one in 2009. However I sold it soon after as it was pretty crap to drive. This new electric model improves on the old car in pretty much every conceivable way.

Positives:

Looks great in the metal.
Finally a good driving position in a 500! Lots of adjustment in the seat and steering wheel. You can sit noticeably lower compared to the old 500.
The central display in the La Prima I drove was responsive and crisp, wireless CarPlay worked faultlessly.
Radar cruise and auto lane hold worked very well.
Performance felt decent. Nippy away from the lights.
Amazing turning circle!
I didn't have time to fully test the efficiency, but it seemed pretty good. Range was stated at 160 miles at 100% when I first got in, I drove for 13 miles at a stated 4 mi/kwh on a mixture of motorway and town driving and got back with 7% used and 147 miles left on the GOM. 

Negatives

Although the interior looks great, there are a few bits where the materials feel cheap.
The ride was generally good, but it tended to thump over serious bumps. Nowhere near as bad as the old 500 though.

Overall I really liked it! It's a pity I couldn't keep it for longer to really see what the efficiency is like and what it's like to live with. I'd also be interested to see what deals are available, at the right price it could be a really compelling package!",,2,2142
49,Thinking about shipping our 2013 Fiat 500e to the UK - am I nuts? (Oops - posting this again in the correct forum),93109,"Nov 19, 2020","I enjoy driving our little Fiat 500e over in California and feel one of these would make a perfect runabout when we are over in the UK. Most of the non EV parts are standard Fiat 500 so in theory it shouldn't be too expensive to maintain standard wear items, tyres, brakes, wipers etc. Some inexpensive reliable Fiat 500e 2013 models here in California can be found for less than $5000. Looking at the cost to ship from the US to the UK should be less than $1000 according to : How Much Does Shipping a Car Overseas Cost? - CostHelper

Once this pandemic has declined, I'm sorely tempted to buy another 500e then pack up our current 500e for the UK but not sure about the current UK car inspection requirements. Looking at the VAT impact it should be zero as it has been owned by us outside the EU (if that even matters anymore) for almost two years. Essentially everything except the drive train and some of the trim is standard Fiat 500 especially safety elements so I would think there would be no additional inspection items required?

Here's an example of a 2016 500e for $5991 https://www.cars.com/vehicledetail/detail/828502330/overview/

Any thoughts - or am I totally crazy?",49,1,7736
50,Fiat 500e (2020) - Youtube Reviews,59017,"Nov 15, 2020","Noticed that quite a few initial reviews of the new electric Fiat 500 are now on Youtube from the German reviewers.

The most interesting one that I came across is linked below (links jumps to charging section), however due to its length the auto generated closed captions aren't available.

Key take aways from the linked video at the 150kW Charger

Car plugged in at 7% - Initial charge rate of 82kW
26 Minutes to 81% - At 81% Charge rate of 42.5kW with 27.7 kWh delivered in that time
42/43kW until 85%, seems as though it is a staircase shaped charge curve
At 85% charge rate drops to 13kW
Around 29 minutes from 7% to 85% - 29.4 kWh delivered in that time
