I am new to both this forum and EVs in general. My Mini Electric arrived last Wednesday and am loving it so far. I have been charging using the dealer-supplied 3 pin cable so far, with the current lock down I'm not exactly going very far at the moment.

I am moving my energy provider to Octopus Agile to take advantage of their variable pricing. I'm planning to get an OHME smart charger which should be able to delay charging to match the lower Agile tariff periods.

Does the Mini support delayed charging managed by a smart charger? I've read that some cars like the MG go to sleep so won't charge when the current becomes available. My thinking is to set the Mini to Charge Immediately and manage the schedule through the OHME app - is that the best approach?

11,Cooper SE Winter Motorway Range,100214,"Oct 26, 2021","Hey all, we're in the process of ordering a Level 3 Electric for delivery in the New Year. 

Like many, we absolutely love the car but are slightly concerned about range. As Londoners, 99% of the time it'll be absolutely outstanding, however, we are a tad concerned about what sort of range to expect when we're doing longer journeys. 

They seldom happen, (1-2 times a year), but when they do, they're typically long and we're not on a jolly, but instead aiming to get from A to B as fast as possible. 

We currently have a C350e PHEV and have made the 1000 mile trip from London to Bratislava numerous times before with an overnight in Frankfurt. During our last trip I made a concerted effort to plug the car in at every services we visited and I'm pleased to say that across Belgium, Germany and Austria we were able to activate AC chargers without issue. Adding CCS and bringing Ionity into the mix means I'm not concerned about finding chargers as they're plentiful along the E40 in Belgium, the A3 that takes us across Germany and the route across Austria. 

What does worry me slightly is how often we'll need to stop... My test drive gave me a chance to loosely measure consumption at about 220wh/km in mild, 14-degree conditions doing 70-75mph, but I'm not sure what range to expect of the car with the heat pump running with thicker air to power through in 0-3 degree temperatures... Would 100 miles of range be achievable ingreen mode and at a reduced speed of 120km/h/75mph? 

Obviously only time will tell, but I'd be interested to hear the winter motorway range experiences of owners on this forum to have a rough idea of how many stops the trip will truly require, otherwise it may just be all too hard and require the plane!",22.0,0,6503

current MINI Clubman Cooper S went for service and required a complete new gearbox replacement, that aside, for the two weeks replacement scheduled work, we were offered a courtesy car, that was a level 1 Electric MINI.

My initial reaction was erm…haven’t you got anything else, erm…no sir, ok, will it get me home, sure it will sir it’s good for 145 miles before it needs charging up, erm…ok.

Having never driven any Electric vehicle before with the exception of a dodgem at the funfair, I really didn’t know what to expect, so once familiar with the controls it was time to head off home, mostly motorway.

What a fun car to drive, before I had got to the motorway less than a mile from the dealership, I was thoroughly enjoying the way it accelerated, such a hoot, and the regenerative braking, fabulous, if judged correctly it’s a one peddle operation, just like the dodgem car at the funfair, with all the usual MINI handling characteristics.

My partner liked it so much that she asked if we could have one, so after the two weeks of fun, and some discussion we ordered in December a level 3 in Green with Satellite Grey interior with piano Black exterior trim including the belt line trim in Black too, the only deletion by the factory was the heated steering wheel, due to global chip shortage, everything else is as we ordered, as per title we collect our level 3 Electric MINI, Saturday.",3.0,5,1484

We ended up booking a days test drive and I liked it and she loved it so the deal was done, so we’ve ordered a level2 in black with, piano black exterior parts and privacy glass and we are getting the roof wrapped in red, we looked at the level 3 but at £5000 more and no refund from the government because it’s over the limit it seems a lot for a few extra bits and we are going away from leather, my wife hated the head up display and I had the Harman karden in my i3s and I wast that impreseed, the only thing I would have ordered would have been the sunroof but it’s not an option.
The only issue is she won’t see it for around 6 months, I just hope she is happy with the down size she has always had SUV’s as I said she has a VW Tiguan now and before that was a Range Rover and so on, I love little quick acceleration cars like my i3s( sold 4 months ago) before that was a Lotus Elise and so on, my current car is petrol but still a small toy, I bought a Suzuki Jimny, it a lot of fun, which is the thing about the Mini just lots and lots of fun.

18,Curbed Corona plug style alloy…,93730,"Feb 3, 2022","Hey all,

So unfortunately I curbed my Corona / plug style alloy at the weekend… 😞

The damage is to the yellow outer rim of the alloy. 

I had to go to Mini for the recall so inquired about an alloy repair. They took one look and said as they were diamond cut alloys they needed a special lathe which they didn’t have onsite as they were a smaller dealership. They advised to go up the road to their sister BMW dealership.

Technician from BMW looked at it and said that although it’s diamond cut it‘s only a repair to the outer rim with a respray of yellow paint, no special lathe required. Only issue he said he’d have was matching the paint as he didn’t have access to Mini paint codes…

Back to Mini the following day and I stated what BMW told me and asked if they’d do it as they would have paint codes. Got an answer back in the afternoon that they still wouldn’t do it as they were a smaller dealership (they aren’t that small) and we’re short of staff. I smelt BS so pushed them and they admitted they’d had the problem before on a used Mini SE they had for sale and they couldn’t get a paint code and ended up ordering a new alloy...

So question is has anyone else curbed their Corona alloy and managed to get a repair? 😬",0.0,0,1639

20,First time EV owner - feasible to make longish phone first trip to get car home?,102682,"Dec 13, 2021","Hi all

Took a mini SE for a test drive a few days ago and absolutely love the car. I’m in Northern Ireland and we really lack the public charging infrastructure at the moment, but my local town has a couple of 50kw charge points and I’ll be getting a wall box at home. With COVID my daily commute needs have really dropped and I genuinely believe I can adopt and live easily daily within the range limits of the car. 

I don’t have a car at the moment and am considering using the ‘new stock mini’ to get a L2 / L3 from England quickly rather than wait on an order. Obviously this requires me to travel to collect car, and then depending on the mini dealer location a drive to either Liverpool or Cairnryan whatever is closer. Either way I’m looking at about possibly 200 miles and from ABRP / Zap Map 3 or 4 stops. This would be my first EV and I’m wondering if this is feasible to do. I’d hope to pick it up early January and would be motorway I’d imagine most of the trip. 

So looking to know communities thoughts on if this a good idea, it would be exception just to get car back to NI rather than the rule. What about motorway speeds? Not fussed if it takes a bit longer but don’t want to stranded somewhere!",30.0,0,4520

I recently ordered a Level 2 Mini Cooper S electric that is due to be delivered next month (November) and looking forward to joining the EV revolution.
Also awaiting installation of a Wallbox charger in the next couple of weeks.
All in all exciting times and with the prospect of higher fuel costs (irrespective of what your vehicle is on) I think I have made the right time to switch.
I am slightly concerned with the range but on paper the Mini should do everything I need it too and be a hoot to drive to which was another reason for opting for the Mini.
Not had a Mini since I learnt to drive (quite) a few years ago now.

33,MINI Countryman PHEV cold issues,78738,"Jan 10, 2021","During the last few days when it has been below freezing, my car will not run in full electric mode.
When I press start (with a fully charged battery) the ICE fires up this is despite having climatised the car whilst plugged in. The gauge on the dash shows zero miles available and there is a message saying battery power temporarily unavailable!
After a few miles running on ICE, the battery warms sufficiently for the car to run in EV mode.
As an example yesterday it was -4C, so I climatised the car. The app showed only 14 miles available but was at 100%. The car would not run in EV mode, so was running on ICE. After around 6 miles or so EV mode became available, but the range was only showing at 6 miles! I continued my shopping trip but after 14 miles the EV mode was no longer available, so my journey was finished on ICE.
So a 16 mile trip, the first 6 and the last couple on petrol, means only 8 in EV mode!
Strangely despite the app showing 14 miles before I left home, it took 6 miles on petrol before EV. mode was available and then the range was showing as 6 miles. How did I loose 8 miles whilst travelling on petrol?
Incidentally the charging port would not latch shut when I unplugged the car, I had to dowse it with de iced, and cycle the door locks a few times before the latch would secure the port door.

37,Electric Mini - Cold weather issues,93889,"Jan 7, 2021","Hi I've been having some problems with a 6 week old electric mini level 2 spec. The weathers been a little chilly at the moment floating around 1 degree down to -1 degree. Cold but not ridiculously cold. My mini is on the drive outside and gradually Ive been having more and more issues with being able to unlock the car doors and more annoyingly being able to open the charge port and often even if the charge port gets opened, either the car won't charge if I insert the cable or won't let me take a cable out if its been left in over night charging as the locking mechanism for the cable seems to also be effected by the cold. I've noticed its easy for water to ingress into the charge port area as there is no seal around the edge of the charge port flap. Water gets in, freezes and causes havoc with the mechanisms to lock and unlock the door and cable. I called Mini support and they said the obvious to pre warm the car and then try. It actually took a couple of pre warm sessions at 20 mins a go to get the car to charge again or release the charge cable. However this week, the remote services that are part of the mini app to remotely pre warm the car or unlock etc have completely stopped working. This morning the car doors were frozen so I couldn't get into the car to manually kick off any heating either. The mini while a brilliant little car is proving to be not so great or usable in moderate cold weather. A little disappointed tbh especially because of its German DNA, it gets very cold in parts of Germany. Does anyone have any ideas about how to avoid having the locking mechanisms freeze up and does anyone have any idea about how to get the app working with remote services again? I've not tried removing and re adding the car yet. Mini suggested brining it in for a service but the next appointment is months away given the current situation with Covid 19 in the UK. Any help greatly appreciated. The mini could really have done with a charge port warmer and if the car is updated its charge port and door need a re design as now they are inherently flawed. Water ingress with no door seal and that the ports are actually angled down into the car mean water pools and freezes. It's a serious design flaw thats left me with an electric ice cube stuck on my drive way for the past few days.

41,Any discounts from list prices yet?,85590,"Aug 25, 2020","I have an all day test drive planned this week and I may be looking to place an order if me and the Mrs both get on with the car.

I have never paid list price for a car before and don't really want to make an exception this time, however when using CARWOW, all I get back is the price less the OLEV discount from all dealers.

Has the fixed OLEV grant effectively killed the idea of discounts or perhaps all the dealers are following the Tesla fixed price example for their BEVs.

I am not in a hurry to buy at the moment as I was going to be using the car for commuting but will be WfH for 3 or 4 days a week until the end of the year so I can wait until a deal comes up.

I would want to get the Level 2 car for not much more than a level 1 price. Is that too ambitious? 

I work in the motor industry supply chain and am aware that the difference in parts cost between the two trim levels which are £2000 apart will be no more than about £200.",4.0,0,2701

43,MINI Countryman Cooper S E Hybrid,4218,"Oct 28, 2016","I'm purposely starting a new thread as the old one contained completely wrong technical specs. There is also a very negative thread in General EV Discussion.

Great technical summary here: In-Depth: 2017 Countryman Cooper S E Hybrid - MotoringFile

I too was very skeptical when I originally thought the new Countryman was based on the same hybrid setup as the BWM Active Tourer. However, it's quite clever. With ICE powering the front wheels and electric at the rear, you get dynamic 4 wheel drive. Power comes from a 134hp 3-cylinder petrol engine and a 87hp electric motor, giving a peak of 221hp. 3 driving modes:

AUTO eDRIVE – Purely electric driving up to 55 mph , the combustion engine is additionally enabled at higher speeds, in particular when accelerating quickly or when the battery charge falls below seven per cent.

MAX eDRIVE – Purely electric driving up to 78 mph , the combustion engine is additionally enabled at higher speeds or on kickdown.

SAVE BATTERY – The car is powered by the combustion engine, the battery charge state is kept above 90 percent or raised to this level by the starter generator.

I currently have a Golf GTE, and this looks quite attractive to me. I will confess a previous interest in Minis, so I am probably biased. Even I will except the new Countryman isn't the prettiest car in the world.",1119.0,1,131185

It's a Level 2 in BRG with white roof and mirror caps, plus those plug-style wheels that went by the name ""Corona"" until just a few weeks ago!

The distinctive colour / wheel combination - chosen by our kids - is just the beginning of my trepidation, though. We'll be relying on a nearby 50kw charger and 3-pin home charging, which enough neighbours seem to get on fine with on our Victorian terraced street. Those lovely wheels will die a terrible death at the hands of my wife and our massive kerb stones - they look impossible to refurbish cheaply!! Plus 100 miles of range and the car's size will be a metaphorical and real-life squeeze... 

But I'm convinced enough that the upsides are worth it and that we fit the usage profile well. (We also have a family van and used to have R56 Minis, which felt too small as the kids grew... but I miss all the same).

Hello, 

After conferring with my colleague, we believe that the car may be incompatible with the charging time feature and the Pod Point.

In the first few 100 miles I put it down to deglazing of the discs / pads or general mechanical bedding and me learning the foibles of a new car, but now i'm finding it a bit more annoying and wondering if anyone else experiences the same ? 

Two areas where I find the pedal feel 'weird' and difficult to modulate correctly are :

1) Very hard braking from high speed (e.g. Coming into a roundabout on a dual carriageway) the initial pedal feel is good with initial good bite, but then the actual retardation really tails off noticeably and the linearity feels artificial and I cant push the pedal hard enough to make the car stop as quickly as I would like it to.... (the first couple of times I experienced it I thought I wasn't actually going to be able to stop in time as I was pushing quite hard and the car didn't slow down any quicker) 

and

2) Low speed pedal feel (e.g. In very slow speed creeping traffic in the urban driving environment) where this time, the pedal effort vs. the retardation is totally the other way around and I find myself stopping too suddenly and end up with passengers nodding forward as my slight brush on the pedal vs. the aggressive slam on of the brakes that results is really hard to control.

I appreciate that the ""actual"" range I get from the battery vs. the predicted data from the MFD are two entirely different propositions, but my drive from home to the airport (23 miles) was completed in full EV mode last week as opposed to running out of coulombs 5 miles from the car park (as I did in mid January) - in similar traffic conditions / driving style etc. 

Thats a (displayed) range delta of nearly 65% variance. 

What do others find / experience ? Is this ""normal"" ?",5.0,0,1263
89,Charging the All4 using E7 cheap rate ? Problems....,76314,"Jan 31, 2019","Hi All
New to this forum and new to PHEV ownership... thankfully not an automotive novice and thats why I feel a little embarrassed to ask this type of question, but hey ho.....

Had my new 'Maxi' a few weeks now and I have gotten my 7kW homecharger (Chargemaster) installed - all systems working perfectly....

My issue is that although I have inputted what my Economy7 times are into both the MFD on the car and the Mini Connected App on my phone, I cant seem to get the car to delay charging until the E7 rate kicks in.....

I have read the instructions manual and just cant seem to do it.... All I want to be able to do is plug the car in when I get home in the evening and the car only charge with the E7 electric and not just charge straight away..... I have selected all of the ""Planned Charge"" times etc, made sure both car and App both are set to the ""Planned Charge"" settings and not to the ""Charge Immediately"", but despite whatever I do, the car just starts charging as soon as I plug her in..... Can someone help please ?",8.0,0,1731

94,Options Explained,48609,"Aug 19, 2018","Hi Folks
I thought I'd set up a thread to help people who are deciding on which options to spec on their new MINI. I found myself asking all sorts of questions when I was deciding mine, as the descriptions are sometimes vague and inconsistent. Perhaps the shared wisdom of actual owners can help people determine just how worthwhile these extras are. I've already been asking random questions on the main thread which is up to 34 pages now so thought it good to start afresh.

In your response, please say whether you own a pre-March update or post-update car, as I think there are some subtle and not so subtle changes which haven't been made clear. 

Here are a couple of starters to get the ball rolling!

1) Does 'Comfort Access' include electronic boot opening? The description on configurator, and an advisor on MINI Chat said 'yes' but I'm dubious.
2) What does the 'Pedestrian Acoustic Warning' actually sound like?

Also, a contribution from me, the Chili Pack now includes auto dimming and electric folding mirrors.",21.0,1,2138

96,End of PHEV purchase grant and new emissions test,14321,"Oct 16, 2018","As of November 9 there is no longer any grant available for the purchase of PHEVs like the Countryman, I got £2,500 off the price of the car when I bought in summer 2017. Moreover the deliveries are being delayed because all cars need to go through the new emissions standards (""WLTP"") following the VW emissions scandal. The tests for PHEV emissions are also totally changed and differentiated from other engine types by doing 2 tests and taking the average result; 1. running it with a full battery to depletion, and 2. running the engine with no battery. Taking the average is kind of meaningless (why not just disclose both results?) but I suppose it creates a single-figure comparison. All cars are going to get much worse results under this WLTP than they did under the discredited predecessor. Wonder how PHEVs will end up faring, if the CO2 emissions go up then could be impact on tax, my car is 49gm/km, but even if it increases up to 100gm/km it is only £95 a year.",3.0,0,1287
97,Back seat driver,40649,"Aug 13, 2018","I recently had a shoulder op so I am unable to drive until mid-September and was on a journey on Sunday and I offered to sit in the back to see what that would be like.

Obviously, the car is quiet in electric mode, but I was pleasantly surprised at how comfortable the seats and suspension were. 

I am 6’ 2’’ and all legs and I had plenty of knee and head room.

I’ve been in Audis which crash over potholes and have been a bit uncomfortable in comparison!

Anyone else discovered new things after owning their car for a few months, good or bad?!",0.0,0,808
