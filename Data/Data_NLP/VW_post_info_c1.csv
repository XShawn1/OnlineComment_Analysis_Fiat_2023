I've been told the car has been manufactured and has left the factory but beyond that, why is it no one can tell me where my car is? it's somewhere between the factory and the dealership but why can't it be tracked? I can't believe that no one knows where it is, and if someone does know why can't that information be propagated? I've got to assume this isn't a specific ID issue but a VW issue, left hand right hand kinda thing but it is a bit ridiculous that there are £20-£50 k assets 'floating about' which no one has an idea of where they are!

3,Contacting head office?,60097,"Apr 17, 2023","Long story long, we ordered an ID Buzz when they first became reservable without the huge deposit, and the ETA for it pretty much from the outset was September 2024, which we were fine with. Since then we've decided to move house and are currently in a (short) chain, which is progressing about as quickly as can be expected with these things. Suddenly last week we got an email from the VW dealer saying that our Buzz is built and expected to be with them mid-next month!

Our mortgage advisor has strongly advised us not to take out any new finance until the move is complete, while the dealer is saying they can only hold onto it for 30 days before VW will want to take it back due to high demand. I have no idea whether we'd get our deposit back in this situation, but he implied that we wouldn't.

Rather than just winging it and hoping for the best, I was wondering whether it would be worth contacting head office and explaining the situation to them as I've seen other people have reasonable results when raising issues directly. To which end, does anybody know the best way to go about that?",17.0,0,729
4,Arteon Shooting Brake eHybrid R Line Long Term Review,98270,"Apr 6, 2023","I'm not sure if this is the right place to post, but dipping back into the forum last night prompted me to write a review of the Arteon, now I've had it for 18 months and 35k miles - mods please move if I've posted this in the wrong section!

This has the potential to be an excellent car, but it's been ruined by an outdated and underpowered hybrid powertrain, and the chassis and brakes haven't been adapted for the extra weight of that powertrain...I test drove the 2L petrol, which was a lovely car to drive as I was unable to test the hybrid - we were just coming out of one of the lockdowns when I was shopping around.

To elaborate on the above, it's a big car, and VW tout it as an executive car; on the motorway, it wafts along serenely as it has adaptive dampers, and I opted for the additional noise suppression pack - double glazed front windows and additional noise deadening, along with the nappa leather interior, giving fully adjustable electric seats, so it is a really nice place to be!

All of the above brings the car close to 2 tons, and having a 1.4 turbo petrol developing just over 150bhp and a low 184 ft/lb torque means you really have to work it to make any progress on twisty fast B roads and uphills, which isn't an enjoyable experience - put your foot down to overtake and you're treated to a nasty thrashy engine note, but you don't make any real progress. So why not use GTE mode I hear you say? Well I do, as that doesn't have a major impact on economy, but it would be nice to be able to set the adaptive dampers to something a little softer than rock hard, so I use GTE mode more to make overtaking safer, rather than using it to make driving on a B road more enjoyable; the car's too big and heavy for that, which leads me on to it's chassis and brakes.

It's chassis can't handle the power (really!), and you have to be very careful when exiting a junction in the wet as it just spins it's 245/40/19 wide tyres (and no, I'm no racing driver, I think the tyres are too wide). When I first had it, I went round a tight corner in the wet, which wouldn't have been a problem in my old car and I was a little shocked that the back end slipped out! The lease company fitted all season tyres not long after I got it which improved things, but still doesn't inspire confidence - an electronic slip diff was available as an option, which I wish I'd have specced, but it's not a race car, so why would it need that? In the wet, I genuinely feel safer in my wife's Smart ForTwo, which is fitted Vredestein Qautracs - that car sticks like poop to a blanket in any condition!

The brakes are too small, underpowered and feel wooden. I only ever drive it B mode (regeneration mode) which gives additional assist, but they're still not up to the job - I regularly carry heavy scuba gear, so with two people and our kit, it's easily tips the 2 ton mark. Everyone who drives it for the first time is shocked by the lack of braking, and how they have to adapt to it. It's just developed a fault with the nearside front disc going off-colour, pitted and rusty, and feels like it's warped. At 35k miles, the rear discs are in a right state and have rust all round them. I don't live near the coast, so apart from the very wet weather we've had over the past months, it doesn't live in a harsh environment.

Ongoing problems with driver assist systems and dealer that's washed their hands of it haven't helped the experience...but that's in another thread.

The widely reported and generally disliked capacitive/haptic touch controls on the steering wheel and climate controls panels are awful to use, with constant accidental touches whilst driving causing cruise control settings to change and the heated steering wheel to come on, etc. It was inexcusable for VW to roll this into production as it's dangerous to use it for systems such as cruise control...It's too late for me (and thousands of others), but it's good to see that VW have admitted this was crap and are ditching it in new models.

Traffic sign recognition unreliable and based on data entry on satnav updates - most of the national speed limit roads show as 30mph near me, and I've had the car try to accelerate to 80mph in a tiny village once. On the motorway driving under bridges or past exits it often slows down to that road's speed or tells me a roundabout's coming up so tries to stop the car. It also doesn't adapt to motorway variable speed limits progressively, so slams the anchors on just as you go under a gantry - I wish I'd never specced it, and quickly learned that you shouldn't rely on these driver assist systems. I genuinely think my driving has become worse since owning a car that can almost drive itself! The first thing I do when getting in the car is to disable lane assist as it's far too aggressive and doesn't work particularly well.

Oh, and the infotainment system! Painfully slow to boot up, so you're always waiting to drive off before you can do anything. It often freezes, requiring a hard reboot, and trying to reliably connect an iPhone/CarPlay is just painful - I can say that I had a Skoda Octavia prior to the Arteon and it was just as bad, and I had a brand new T-Roc loan car when it was in for one of it's unsuccessful diagnoses on the assist systems, and it's system froze as soon as I got in the car...It also sounds rubbish, I've found that pushing the fader all the way to the front makes a big improvement as the rear tweeter is nearer to your head than the front so it just sounds weird with the fader set to the middle.

With the seats down, it can fit an awful lot, however as I recently found trying to take an old wardrobe to my parents', even broken down, with it's high bumper lip and low roofline, my wife and I had three attempts at 'Tetris' before we found a solution to get the wardrobe in, so it's not the most practical, but hey, that's the price of such good looks, and I'mnot going to do that very often 

All that said, it's an achingly beautiful car (one of the most beautiful currently on the market, in my opinion), especially in the Kings Red Metallic I went for, and with the optional double glazing/sound-proofing and fully electric Nappa leather seats, it's a wonderful mile muncher on the motorway.

I'm sure the petrol and diesel are wonderful to drive (if it weren't for the company car tax implications, I'd have gone for the 190bhp petrol or AWD diesel), however VW have really missed the mark with the eHybrid and it looks like it's already been discontinued, which, to me, says a lot...18 months into this 5 year sentence, and I'm hoping for early parole (I'm quietly hoping that the new garage can't get to the bottom of the driver assist system problems and the lease company take it back)...My wife doesn't like it, and often asks if we can get my old car back - a Skoda Octavia Vrs 4x4, which we sold to a friend who absolutely loves it!

9,ABT Volkswagen e-transporter charging speed at home,6151,"May 19, 2021","We are running an ABT e-transporter in our business and it is a great van for our local needs.

Just wondered if anyone else owns or runs an ABT e-transporter and is managing to charge it ok at home?
We are managing really well with a 3 pin plug at the moment and have rapid charged it a couple of times. Is anyone else charging the e-transporter on a 7.2kw wallbox at home and what times are you getting.

The reason I am asking is that I have been in contact with VW over the cable that is provided with the van. a 20A cable. My complaint to them is that I would have presumed they would provide a 32A cable seeing as it states the van can charge at 7.2kw/h. They are now digging themselves a hole and have said it won't charge at higher than 3.6kw/h on single phase electricity no matter what cable is used and even with a home charger fitted?!

15,VW vs Tesla ACC,93992,"Jun 22, 2022","A question for @Tooks and anyone who has owner experience (or reasonable rental time rather than a test drive) of both Tesla and VW ev.

I use ACC on the ID3 a lot, for me its a real stand out feature and I really trust it. I occasionally get erroneous red flashes on the ID light but I have never had a breaking event that doesn't make sense. Sometimes it's more cautious than I would like it to be (usually slow moving vehicles leaving a dual carriageway, it takes a while to clear the breaking event after the car has left the carriage way) but overall I have been really impressed with the system.

I've got a year and a bit on my lease so probably need to start thinking about what I should buy next. I keep seeing comments about Tesla phantom breaking in certain modes and get a little confused about what the equivalent function names in a VW would be and can I avoid the breaking events with the functions I want to use.

I'm not massively interested in any lane keeping or steering autonomy, I just want the car's cruise control to safely pick up speed limit signs, match the speeds of other vehicles, not undertake other vehicles and not make me sh*t myself with random braking. The predictive regen on the VW is great too, the way it knows a roundabout is coming and regens automatically. Can the Tesla do this stuff as well as my ID3 and is it trustworthy? Is the phantom breaking a real thing or is it overblown?",30.0,0,2746

18,Failure to charge.,41889,"Aug 13, 2022","I have had an e-Golf for over 4 years.
I've cracked the problem of getting it to charge overnight during the cheap period of my Octopus Go tariff.
About a year ago I started noticing that sometimes it had not charged when it should have done. This might happen about 2 or 3 times a month.
It only seemed to happen with my home charger. I could get charged at public charging points (CCS) and at my daughter's house which has an Andersen box with a tethered cable.
So it looked as if my charging point was intermittently faulty.
I was in the process of getting quotes for a new one when I took the car to a VW dealer for another unrelated problem. I mentioned the charging problem and they said that there had been a recall on the charging cables, but since it was not a safety problem, it had not been widely publicised.
The original cable supplied with the vehicle had already been replaced once under guarantee within the first year, the stress relief failed and the wires were not clamped to the car plug.
The dealer replaced the cable for free under the recall and I've had no further charging problems since and saved myself a lot of money not having to replace the charging point.
The new cable is considerably heavier and more robust than the old one.
So, if you have any charging problems, it's worth contacting your VW main dealer to see if you are covered by the recall before taking any expensive decisions.

https://cariad.technology/de/en/company.html



It’s up to 5500 employees apparently, and they’re still recruiting, but it’s encouraging that VW recognise that software is very important to the automotive future and are investing substantial amounts to make it happen.

Owning both an ID and M3, I do have plenty of opportunity to experience both software platforms and can compare first hand how fit for purpose they are.

So, let’s get that out of the way;

Tesla screen interaction is definitely ’snappier’, the CPU horsepower behind it is evident (AMD Ryzen based I believe).

The Tesla UI is non customisable and I do find the fonts a bit fiddly and hard to read sometimes. And, just when I get used to where everything is, they issue an OTA update and it all moves again… 😂

ID screen is very readable, and I like the way you can customise what is important to you. The responsiveness is improving all the time as well with each software version.

The fact that Tesla still doesn’t have CarPlay or Android Auto is a mystery.

Voice activation and control seems pretty good in both the VW and Tesla, an underused feature I think.

Bottom line is that I don’t tend to use the screen much once underway, so don’t get the complaints about lag etc, and they both do the job. I’m pleased though that VAG are putting so much effort into what needs to be done, and appear to be listening to the feedback.",18.0,0,1477

If you are interested in partaking in the study or just learning more about my research in general and the benefits I anticipate it will bring to Wales, please feel free to send a message through this platform where we can introduce each other and share some short documents describing my research.

37,State of Health data,96985,"Dec 13, 2021","My 17 plate Passat GTE is getting close to 100,000 miles which is when the warranty on the battery runs out. I had the car in for a service at Alan Day Hampstead and asked them to tell me what the state of health is on the battery. The mechanic initially told me about 12V battery condition, but went to check when I clarified that I was asking him about the battery for the drive system. He told me that they were unable to provide this information without getting a code from Volkswagen.
This doesn't really make sense to me. I was of the impression that a main dealer would have access to all the diagnostic information including the state of health figure for the battery, especially a main dealer that is able to service PHEVs. Has anyone else managed to get this information and what hoops did you have to jump through?

38,"Abte transporter finally delivered , has anyone had any success with a complaint yet?",103386,"Dec 31, 2021","Hi, I have just got my transporter and realise it is a very compromised van but should meet my needs local use predominantly and the lease deal was so attractive especially with selling my previous van at higher than purchase price. But....

So I started the search online and ended up here, great forum especially as our other vehicle is a bmw i3s which I love and it helped me decide to change my work vehicle for an ev too.

I ordered the van expecting the 7kw fast charge AC, as per brochure. I have attached a copy of my brochure charge details sorry poor copy low ink! But I have now found it is only charging around 3kw. Not very good on octopuss energy cheap rate 4hr window. So not a full charge CV in 5.5hrs more like 11hrs. Having contacted my charger manufacturer thinking it was the charger and getting a little grumpy with them they investigated everything and low and behold it is the vehicle. As another post mentions it is the way the transporter is built and you require 3 phase.

I have read a lot about the other VW croup Evs suffering the same and they have had a software/coding update to enable single phase 7kw charging. The VW e Up for instance.

Does anyone more tech savvy and knowledgeable know if this is a possibility with the abte transporter? I am currently investigating before I go to the dealer.

Such a shame as I do like the van but not impressed having to pay a hefty bit more to charge each day. 

I will have to calculate the difference between the 5p per kWh off peak and 24p per kWh normal rate over the lease based on 20k miles. I originally thought worse case 1hr per day at higher rate and rest cheap rate.

Any other owners had any dealings with VW on this subject and any results?

Many thanks and happy New year",11.0,0,3116

I have a 2 month old VW E Transporter - LWB Advance.

To look at this van is great and you can see the usual VW workmanship is there. It is all very good quality.

The problem is the EV system,

The range on the brochure is dreamy! i get around 60-65 miles and thats driving so slow and lifting and coasting to regenerate when i can.

It has broken down on me now 3 times,

I've had battery malfunction, all electrics fail and yesterday after doing 4 miles from fully charged the van decided to tell the ECU the batteries were empty with no charge. It was highly embarrassing and the VW assist team gave a 2 hour time to come and recover me. Luckily an engineer rang and said the 12v battery needed to be disconnected and re connected. I did this and the van sprung back into life.

Then there is the constant juddering when pulling away, the gearbox does not a have a clue what to do when going up any sort of hill and if you lift off for speed bumps and then accelerate again its like a ride at alton towers. Trying to book the van in to the dealership and get a vehicle to use whilst its with them is near impossible.

I can live with the range but i cannot live with the rest of the issues.....

57,DIY VW Passat B4 EV Conversion,96110,"Apr 27, 2021","Howdy, SpeakEV community!

This is my first post here. I'm converting my trusty VW Passat B4 to EV and wanted to share my progress.

I bought this car a long time ago and quickly fell in love with it. I covered quite some miles with this car and I can safely say that it's a very special vehicle.
This isn't my first EV conversion project, some years ago I converted ZAZ-1103 to electric power. The project was fun, learned a lot while making it.
Another EV conversion project that we did quite some time ago was a Ukrainian Niva conversion, which turned out really great. 

Challenges
This time, besides transition to electric power, my goal here is to keep all car systems in working condition. Starting from the power steering, power-assisted brakes, air conditioner and so on...

Why Passat?
You may ask ""Why Passat""? 
Firstly, everything in this car is really well done. It has a quite advanced configuration for its years. Air conditioner, heated seats, airbags, ABS, it has practically everything you need.
At the same time, this car is quite simple. It doesn't have a central computer, so it'll be relatively easy to make all these systems work.
Of course, there will be some challenges, but nothing too complicated.

Main components

Battery pack - 2P26S, 200Ah NMC ~20kWh
An asynchronous motor with the copper rotor
Curtis 1238 controller 84V 550A
Flatpack2 charger
BMS A1109 + A11039G2

Progress summary
For someone who wasn't following along on my YouTube channel, I'll quickly sum-up my progress to date:

Oct. 9, 2020: Power steering is working
Oct. 30, 2020: The motor is installed and working
Nov. 13, 2020: Heater and air conditioner installed
Apr. 18, 2021: First Test Drive

Plans for the future
So, going forward my plan is to ensure stability and operability of all standard vehicle systems like power steering, power assisted brakes, air conditioning, ABS, etc. 
I'll keep you all posted with my progress. 

Here's my first test drive video:
P.S. English captions available

Reading in another thread about charging on the road I saw example prices of 31 p/kWh and 36 p/kWh at Osprey & Instavolt respectively - which I thought was rather expensive.

I did some calculations based on the following assumptions:

I have 10.4 kWh usable battery on my car
Current petrol cost = 109.9p per litre (cheapest around here)
I can manage 30 miles range on purely electric (regularly doing so at the moment)
I could manage 50 mpg in my last ICE Passat, '13 plate (sometimes more on trips)
At 31p per kWh, a full recharge would cost £3.22
At 36p per kWh, a full recharge would cost £3.74
30 miles in my old ICE Passat would cost £3.00.
(Even at 40 mpg this would be £3.75)
I dread to think what motorway service stations charge and what these costs would amount to!

Obviously, charging at home, the Electric cost is roughly halved and therefore much cheaper to fill up - definitely worth getting your home charger guys!!

I just wanted to share my experience of applying for a three month payment deferral with VW. Basically they have a simplistic form that I filled in Payment Deferral in which I stated I wanted to keep the car, was not vulnerable and was seeking a three month break (or a no to their backwardly worded 3 months or less break). I filled this in on April 29th.

On the 30th I received an email to say my PCP account was on pause while they reviewed my submission and today they have said it was rejected because:

“
We noted from your Payment Deferral request that you did not wish to keep your vehicle, therefore VWFS has not deemed a Payment deferral to be a suitable option for you.

 

Next steps:

We will unsuspend your agreement in 10 working days’ time – this means that payments will start billing again. Any payments that were due before or during your agreement being suspended will be considered as overdue, therefore it is important we work with you now to agree an suitable support option and arrange a safe handback of your vehicle.



Therefore please call us on 0370 010 2022 as a matter of urgency so that we can route you through to the team who can arrange that for you.”

I sent back a strongly worded email to ask them to review my form submission because I didn’t tick the box to return the car.

It even pops up with all the speed limits every time you enter a country, see picture.

Charging also worked really well. I have a New Motion RFID card as they have won the contract for the new public chargers in the Go Ultra Low scheme in Oxford. In Holland they have integrated all companies (who recharge each other) so I was able to use it everywhere - with 28 spaces (28 type 2 charging points) within 800m of where I was staying - they are everywhere and often 22kWh (which is of course useless to me but great for BEVs). Worked in Germany too but fewer chargers around- not sure if they have the same system as Holland but lucky there was a New Motion charger 1km from my hotel. Also managed to charge at Folkestone on the way out and nearly filled the battery as there were delays.

The thoughts of experienced owners would be much appreciated. The sites have differing and somewhat conflicting comments about the use of domestic power supply.

One from VW marketing the car says:

The benefit of AC (alternating current) is that it’s what standard UK plug sockets use, so everywhere has it. It’s the most common method of vehicle charging.

It doesn’t take long to charge up your Passat GTE saloon from home. You can get 100% charge in just 4 hours 15 minutes using your standard 3 pin plug socket. So while you’re getting your 8 hours sleep, your car’s recharging too - just in half the time.

The other one from EVBox which is marketing their EV Box says:

Regular electricity outlet 2.3 kW 4h15m This charging method is intended for emergencies only. 

EVBox 1-Phase, 16A 3.7 kW 2h40m This charging station is the best fit for this car!

Just wanted to raise awareness that there might be a common fault of vertical line(s) of dead pixels on the infotainment screen. It easily goes unnoticed, in my case I only noticed it when using Waze via my phone.

My e-golf was only 8 months old when I noticed it and when I mentioned it to a colleague who has a 1 year old Golf R it turned out that he had two rows of dead pixels which had gone unnoticed until I mentioned it to him and he tested it. I also found a few Google results that mention it.

VW replaced mine without any fuss. It took a couple of weeks to order a replacement part but the job itself was done within a couple of hours. I dropped it off at 8 and I think they called me at 11AM to say it was ready for collection.

I will certainly be keeping an eye on it to see if it happens again.",0.0,3,1409

139,What will VW do for 4 years??,2516,"Nov 17, 2018","Hi;

I know some have speculated about the eGolf / eUP being in limbo or ""maybe"" getting new cells that make it competitive. But, I am trying to interpret the news that VW is announcing (again) and it seems to me they are on the one hand ""talking big stuff"" while on the other looking for exit strategies. 

I mean, the ""moves"" in China speak to capitulation or at minimum ""loss of control"". Also, what type ""partnership"" can possibly last with a competitor? If they are ""talking"" to Ford, it means ""sooner or later"" merger. 

Lastly, if none of that M&A stuff works, and they do make their ID car in 2022  what the heck are they going to be making for the next four years??? My guess is that is yet another ""delay"" tactic, to show ""potential investors"" they are ""serious"" while at the same time doing nothing and hoping they can come into the game (if all the grand exit and executive bonus pans drizzle out) in 3-4 years with production capacities. Letting the R&D + market mature outside their boardroom is probably the right move when you have little leadership potential in the nascent market. 

Do not want to be pessimistic here...I really liked the first series of VW EVs....but I am not seeing much ""faith"" anything will be happening from their side for a few years. Besides that, they never really have been friendly or ""involved"" in the EV community. 

Might be time to look more at Tesla 3 now that they have made it to France finally.

Autoweek has a few new details about the ID cars based on its conversation with Ulbrich. The cars will all have three computers on board. All that computing power will be available to manage self-driving features that emerge in the future. The cars will be capable of over-the-air updates — no visit to dealers required. They will be rear-wheel drive, giving them near perfect 50–50 front-to-rear weight distribution. The standard motor will be a permanent magnet unit with about 160 horsepower. All-wheel-drive variants will add a synchronous motor to the front with another 50 to 60 horsepower.

The MEB chassis can be lengthened or shortened to fit the needs of various models. Even the width of the cars can be varied by substituting different suspension components. The battery pack will use pouch or prismatic cells supplied by either LG Chem or Samsung SDI. Volkswagen will assemble the cells into battery packs, which can vary in size from 50 t0 80 kWh. The largest battery can fit within the MEB chassis even in its shortest wheelbase configuration. Scalability will allow Volkswagen to add or subtract range and allow customers a choice of price points.

There will be two cooling circuits — a high-temperature one for the motors and a low-temperature one for the battery pack. Heat for the interior will be provided by electricity. No word on whether the cars will use advanced heat pump technology or low-tech resistance heating for that task.",0.0,3,1017

Apparently they will likely build other cars on it before the BUDD-e(what is it with the rubbish names)

The choice off MPVs currently are 
Outlander(not really an MPV)
e-NV200(a literal not very mini VAN)

and... oh thats it!

Im really suprised that after seeing the success off the Outlander(which is delayed into the US due to continued European success) other manufacturers are not jumping on to the MPV platform, VW should be jumping on this as a primary(I can understand the egolf, its a conversion)

Then the heat from the first keeps the interior temp up a bit for when the second kicks in and hopefully does the proper job in fully clearing the windscreen and maybe some of the rear side windows unstick enough for the motors to lower them.

190,Groan on steering full lock in Golfs,1016,"Nov 1, 2017","This message is for eGolf and Golf GTE owners, although it may apply to other VW owners too.

Ever since we have had the car we have noticed a slight groaning coming from the front of the car on full lock when turning right at low speeds. It's not always there and sadly I have found it hard to replicate it while test driving it in the presence of a servicing engineer. It has never struck us as particularly serious and has not got any worse in the last two years. Nevertheless I thought I would ask the garage to look at at it on the final warranty inspection; however they could not find anything at all wrong with the car.

I have googled this and found quite a few owners of Golfs going back to the Mk IV complaining about this, but all without exception shared my experience that no-one could find any thing wrong with the car to explain it. Some people said it got better after replacing the bushes on the front anti-roll bar, but this seemed to have been illusory.

The one thing that seems to be closest to consensus on this is that it is just the sound the power steering makes when under load - that would certainly square with kt being more noticeable in heavier Golfs like mine.

Has anyone else noticed this and come to any alternative conclusions? Funnily enough I see that there are mentions of possibly similar symptoms coming from the power steering in a Tesla Model S.",8.0,0,7304

8 Year High Voltage Battery Warranty

A guarantee for eight years or 99,360 miles (160,000 km) whichever comes first, on all material or manufacturing defects.
Gradual reduction in battery capacity over time is integral to the nature of the component, and does not represent a defect under the terms of this guarantee, as long as the reduction in capacity is not in excess of the value specified for this vehicle in the owner's manual.
The guarantee on high voltage batteries does not apply if the defect has been caused by the battery not being used, handled or maintained as described in the owner's manual. This applies in particular to charging the battery. 
With the exception of the warranty term, all warranty conditions stipulated by the Volkswagen Retailer selling the vehicle (pre-requisites, criteria for freedom from defects, exclusions, settlement of claims, entry into force and start of extended warranty term, scope of application etc.) Also apply to the high voltage battery.

198,Climate controls - maddening reset,2516,"Sep 17, 2017","Hello;

I have a new model or 2nd generation e-UP and I wanted to see if other VW models have the same issues I am experiencing. When the car is started, after about 15min at rest, the climate controls revert to 22c and sometimes Auto, sometimes with A/C and other times with heat on. Since I live in the south of France, the cabin can get hot, and the A/C I guess, is being triggered. 

I have not found any way to keep the controls in ""manual"" mode. I do not have the drive on Eco or Eco+ and drive always in ""normal mode"". So, I am confused as to why the fan controls never stay ""fixed"" in a manual position. 

Besides the frustration of having to reset the climate control overtime I enter the car, it is bizarre that manual is behaving like ""auto mode"". The main killer to me is I do not want the A/C on, and many times other people driving the car do not have the habit of shutting of the A/C no matter the temp outside. The only thing I can think if is to pull the fuse for the A/C or maybe there is a software support ""desk"" someplace in ""VW land"" I could write to. Or.....if anyone knows of a combination or trick to keep the console in manual mode I would love to hear it.",2.0,0,893

200,GTE public charging whilst travelling the UK,30697,"Aug 31, 2017","I have a sneaking suspicion that charging a GTE whilst travelling the UK will be a fruitless task unless the charger is convenient to my journeys and destinations, timely with my meetings and/or hotel stay or cost effective/FOC. That said I have signed up to Polar (apparently I can use CYC as well), NewMotion and Source London. Is there any others of note? My thinking is in some cases the charger/parking space can be pre booked (Source London) and almost guarantees a parking space in key congested areas, the higher cost to charge is negated by potentilly FOC parking charges which in many cases in the big smoke can be £5 for and hour or two or £15 for 4-5 hours, or higher!! Charging and/or parking cost is all expensed to the business travel. As will fuel costs, so its swings and roundabouts of where the thravel/parking budget is spent.

Between urban areas I will likely be harvesting a few electrons whilst in hybrid or GTE mode ready for the next city. Some weeks I' could be on the road 3-4 days with no home or workplace charging.

Whilst BEV's get snooty at PHEV's in public charging spaces, which I entirely get, my retort would be every mile on E mode is a mile less C02 pumped out regardless. On some urban days, I will potentially get 100% E mode travel as long as charging, albeit at a slow rate, during the day whilst in meetings. If there were a strong spec'd Passat Estate sized BEV with 150-200 mile range for circa £40k, I'd have bought it!

I found this part interesting:
""Audi has already stated that it will be using MEB for its models after year 2020, and one can assume it won't be far behind the Volkswagen brand in this development, if behind at all.

Volkswagen says that the first car in the MEB series will be in the overall size of the ID concept car it showed in September 2016. It has a footprint (length/width) fairly similar to a Golf, but it's taller, and because of the height and interior packaging, it has more interior space than a Golf.

Soon thereafter, MEB versions of all conceivable body styles and sizes will follow: Sedans, crossovers, SUVs, minivans and so forth. The full roll-out of 30 models is targeted for completion by 2025.""

With a new vehicle am I asking too much if I ask my local dealership to give me a quick exterior clean in their valet bay?
And is it really too much to ask if they can remove the ICEs they have parked in the EV parking area so that I may charge whilst I'm visiting?

Now when I bought My Toy#Yoda I found that it did not matter which dealership I visited, the PR in every one being second to none with the staff doing all they could and more to keep the smile on face, which is in contrast my local VW whom didn't seem to have the time of day, and were also clueless when it came to my request for help in setting car-net up, telling me the vehicle did not have it.

The first serial production hybrid was, of course the Prius that started production in December 1997 whilst the Audi A4 DUO III started serial production earlier in 1997.

Oh, yeah, sorry, misleading you there, like Toyota do too. The Audi A4 DUO III was the first serial hybrid. 

... or was it?...... I'm not exactly sure when the few customers that bought one actually started receiving their DUO III's, perhaps Prius was the first to market. I'm not really sure. But for sure Audi beat Toyota to displaying a viable prototype by 10 years.

The fact that Toyota got the glory - I don't know whether that was testament to Toyota's resilience and determination, or Audi's lack of keep up with its engineering leadership.

Parking spaces driven to fully automatically
Electric vehicles charged automatically
V-Charge places only minor demands on car park infrastructure
Intelligent form of valet parking
Volkswagen AG aspires to holding the leading position in the field of automated parking. A look into the near future of automated parking is given by 'V-Charge', an EU research project, in which six national and international partners are jointly developing new technologies. Its focus is on automating the search for a parking space and on the charging of electric vehicles. The best part about it is that the vehicle not only automatically looks for an empty parking space, but that it finds an empty space with charging infrastructure and inductively charges its battery. Once the charging process is finished, it automatically frees up the charging bay for another electric vehicle and looks for a conventional parking space. 'V-Charge' stands for Valet Charge and is pointing the way to the future of automated parking.

In the USA especially, convenient valet parking is a big hit: you pull up in your car right outside your destination, valet service personnel park it for you and have it brought around again as and when you need it. There is no more time-wasting search for a parking place. The V-Charge project picks up on this idea. Its development goal is fully automated searching for a parking space ('valet parking') within defined zones, such as in multi-storey car parks.

There are many scenarios that illustrate the advantages of the V-Charge concept. Take one practical everyday example: a commuter notices that he is possibly going to be late and is thus running the risk of missing an important meeting at his company. With V-Charge he is able to pull up right in front of the main entrance, get out and establish the link to his vehicle via the associated smartphone application. Operating fully automatically, the vehicle has a digital map relayed to it and within the parking area or multi-storey car park autonomously navigates to a parking space. If it is an electric vehicle, the system additionally prioritises a parking bay with an automatic charging facility. Pedestrians, cyclists and other vehicles are identified by the cameras and ultrasound sensors integrated within the vehicle. Therefore, the vehicle is allowed to travel in so-called 'mixed traffic'. The selected parking area neither has to be an enclosed domain nor is any complex technical equipment required.

As the electric vehicle nears its destination, the system recognises via local sensors whether the allocated parking space is taken. If it is empty, the fully automatic parking manoeuvre begins and positions the vehicle exactly above the inductive charging spot. When the charging process is complete, the vehicle automatically moves to another parking space, leaving the charging station free for another electric car. When the driver returns to the multi-storey car park, he calls the vehicle back to the starting point via the V-Charge app. The vehicle moves to the defined pick-up location, with the driver not needing to set foot in the parking area or multi-storey car park.

Taking the lead in the international research consortium is the Swiss Federal Institute of Technology (ETH) in Zurich. It is responsible for visual localisation, movement planning and vehicle control (Autonomous Systems Lab division), camera calibration, 3D reconstruction from images and obstacle detection (Computer Vision and Geometry Lab division).

BraunschweigTechnical University works on the issues of car park management and the vehicle's communication with the technical surroundings (vehicle-to-infrastructure'V2I'), Robert Bosch GmbH contributes its expertise in the field of sensor technology, Parma University looks after object recognition and Oxford University handles the development of detailed navigation maps of the parking area (semantic mapping concepts). As the sixth partner in the consortium, Volkswagen is providing the platform equipment, safety and control modules, as well as systems for static monitoring of surroundings, object recognition and automated parking.










The test vehicle: a network of technical sensory organs

The technical prerequisites largely already exist. During the introductory stage, for instance, it was possible to utilise sensor and camera technologies that are already being used in today's production vehicles. A dense network of sensory devices enables autonomous operation of the V-Charge test vehicle, which is based on a Volkswagen e Golf1. Four wide- angle cameras and two 3D cameras, twelve ultrasound sensors, digital maps and the so- called 'Car2X' technology for the vehicle's communication with the infrastructure ensure that the vehicle's surroundings are reliably detected and recognised. Pedestrians, vehicles and obstacles get identified, parking spaces recognised and measured and then this stream of data is put together in real timeto form an overall picture – the task that the technical 'sensory organs' have to fulfil is complex and extremely varied.

As continual tests run as part of the research project show, V-Charge is already functional today. GPS-independent indoor localisation, centimetre-exact parking space measurement and 360-degree recognition of surroundings all function reliably, as do the system's reactions to pedestrians and vehicles and the way in which it takes account of traffic moving in line with or across the vehicle's path.

2005: a Volkswagen Touareg called 'Stanley'makes the first move towards autonomy
At Volkswagen automatic motoring moved from being a vision to a field of research at an early stage. 'Stanley' – a Touareg converted in cooperation with Stanford University in California and the Volkswagen Electronics Research Laboratory (USA) into a laboratory that could drive autonomously – was already winning the Grand Challenge competition for robot vehicles as far back as 2005. The next stage of development, in 2007, was the Passat 'Junior', which even then was finding its way through the big-city jungle without a driver – and doing so with such success that it took second place in the Urban Challenge for autonomous vehicles.

Given the working titles 'PAUL' and 'iCar', two further Passat research vehicles also demonstrated their autonomous capabilities that same year. While, thanks to intelligent parking assistance with no driver involvement, 'PAUL' slips into spaces perpendicular to the carriageway, the 'intelligent car' makes life easier for the driver in stop-and-go situations and on long monotonous journeys by automatically braking and keeping the appropriate distance.

In 2011, the 'eT – follow me!' microvan was launched as the ideal vehicle for delivery services. One real-life scenario: If the driver walks from house to house along a street delivering letters, for example, 'eT' follows him on quiet electric paws like a well-trained dog to ensure his mailbag is constantly replenished ('FollowMe' function) – or stays on his spot like a good boy until receiving the electronic 'come to me' call.

Also taking to the stage of autonomous motoring in 2011 was the 'HAVE-IT' (Highly Automated Vehicles for Intelligent Transport), a Volkswagen AG contribution to the research project of the same name funded by the European Commission. The Wolfsburgengineers had developed for the Passat Variant a 'temporary autopilot', which set the best possible degree of automation for driving on motorways and similar roads based on the driving situation, surroundings, the driver's condition and the system status.",4.0,0,1286

289,VW's autonomous braking system cuts third party injury claims by 40%,1,"May 20, 2015","Just a press release from VW, but I thought it may be of interest to some on here so worth sharing.




The Volkswagen Golf and Passat models have been praised by vehicle safety experts at the Thatcham Research Centre, who have seen a 45 per cent drop in third party personal injury insurance claims thanks to the fitment of auto-emergency braking systems.

The latest generation Golf went on sale in the UK in January 2013. All except for the entry-level S models have Adaptive Cruise Control (ACC) as standard, with ACC including the radar sensor controlled distance monitoring system Front Assist, as well as city emergency braking and cruise control. Since launch, third party injury claims on the latest Golf are 45 per cent lower than for the equivalent ‘Small Family Car Control Group’.

Matthew Avery, Director of Safety at Thatcham Research, said: ‘These findings are based on the equivalent of more than 7,000 Mk VII Golf models insured for a full 12 months on the road, and come from claims data from our insurance members. When we saw figures based on an initial small sample, we were surprised, as they exceeded our own performance testing. However the figures held up, even after almost doubling the sample group, and have therefore given us a glimpse of what safety on UK roads could look like in the future.’

Although such systems are not new, it was the Golf that ’democratised safety’ and brought ACC to a wide audience. The system operates over a speed range from 30 to 160 km/h (approx. 18 to 99 mph) with a manual gearbox and with DSG. In vehicles with DSG, it can intervene to such an extent that the car may be slowed to a complete standstill. In normal driving ACC maintains a preselected speed and a defined distance to the vehicle ahead, and it automatically brakes or accelerates in flowing traffic. Front Assist continually monitors the distance to the traffic ahead and assists the driver in critical situations by preconditioning the brake system and alerting the driver to any required reactions by means of visual and audible warnings. If the driver fails to brake hard enough, the system automatically generates sufficient braking force to help avoid a collision. Should the driver not react at all, Front Assist automatically slows the car so that the speed of any impact is minimised. The system also assists the driver by an alert if the car is getting too close to the vehicle in front. The city emergency braking function is also part of Front Assist and operates at speeds below 30 km/h (approx. 18 mph). 

The new Passat which went on sale in the UK in January also now has ACC as standard on all but S models. With a further developed system, as well as the ability to detect pedestrians, early indications from Thatcham are that the reductions in accidents could be even more significant. ACC is also available on other models including the Polo and Touareg, while city emergency braking is offered on the up! city car.

Avery continues: ‘If the performance of these latest generation auto-emergency braking systems translates to the real world as expected, then it stands to reason that we should see third party personal injury claims continuing to fall across the board.’

Commenting on the findings, Alex Smith, Director of Volkswagen UK, said: ‘We knew the fitment of ACC was significant when we launched the Golf, and this was reflected in reduced insurance group ratings from Thatcham. To have even greater than expected reductions reflected in real world accident data is fantastic, as we know we’re contributing to cutting the human and financial impacts of accidents as well. The trend towards standard fitment is also set to continue as new vehicles are launched.’

292,VW C Coupe GTE Concept,1,"Apr 21, 2015","Press release:

Wolfsburg, April 20, 2015: Volkswagen has presented the new C Coupé GTE at Auto Shanghai 2015. This four-door concept car for the Chinese market – which is over five metres in length – combines exclusivity, perfection and passion. The C Coupé GTE is powered by an innovative plug-in hybrid drive system, whose drive sources combine to produce an impressive 500 Newton metres of system torque.

The progressive C Coupé GTE illustrates a new design approach for Volkswagen’s top future saloons. Its contemporary form is impressive from all angles: while its long bonnet conveys a confident appearance, from the side, the four-door C Coupé GTE shows elegant lines, low-profile side windows and horizontal character line that is formed by two lines. From the rear, this structure comes together distinctively, emphasising the vehicle’s width.

The C Coupé GTE has one of the world’s most advanced plug-in hybrid drive systems. It consists of a turbocharged petrol direct-injection engine (TSI) with four cylinders,an 8-speed automatic gearbox, an electric motor integrated in the gearbox module and a lithium-ion battery. The TSI engine produces 210 PS, while the electric motor has a power output of 124 PS. The hybrid drive develops a system power of 245 PS and an impressive system torque of 500 Nm. The battery integrated at the rear can be charged while driving or while parked.

The C Coupé GTE can also be powered all-electrically (up to a speed of 130 km/h (81 mph)); this mode enables driving with zero local emissions and a range of 50 kilometres (31 mph). The car’s combined fuel consumption (NEDC for plug-in hybrid vehicles) is 2.3 litres per 100 kilometres. This figure equates to CO2emissions of just 55 g/km. The car’s total driving range is over 800 kilometres (497 miles). Despite its excellent fuel efficiency, the C Coupé GTE also has sporty ambitions. This Volkswagen accelerates to 62 mph in 8.6 seconds and reaches a top speed of 232 km/h (144 mph).

Max 31 miles range in EV only mode
Combines TSI engine and electric motor for maximum power output of 218 PS
Total driving range of over 600 miles

The NEDC consumption (for hybrid vehicles) is over 141 mpg (under 2.0 l/100 km) and 13.0 kWh/100 km; these values equate to CO2 emissions lower than 45 g/km



















Full press release:

The new Passat is one of the most innovative cars in its class. Equipped with progressive drive, assistance and infotainment systems, it is high-tech encapsulated in a powerful design with sharp proportions. The eighth generation Passat is currently being launched in Europe, and already, Volkswagen has come up with something more: the German car maker is showing the Passat GTE in a world premiere at the Paris Motor Show – the first Passat with a plug-in hybrid drive system.

It is a zero-emission and long-distance vehicle in one and available as a saloon or estate. In GTE mode, the Volkswagen also has a sporty side. Plug-in hybrid, in this case, means the combination of a turbocharged direct injection petrol engine (TSI) with an electric motor, which is supplied with energy from an externally (or in Charge mode) chargeable lithium-ion battery. Thanks to this battery, the Passat GTE can cover a distance of up to 31 miles in all-electric mode and thus with zero emissions. At the press of a button next to the gear lever, the driver can also control the all-electric mode (""E-Mode"") at will – for example, at the end of a drive when the destination is in a city.

A contrast to the ""E-Mode"" is offered by the mode ""GTE"", which is also accessible at the press of a button – in this mode, the Passat delivers a maximum system output of 160 kW / 218 PS; a wide variety of parameters such as the accelerator pedal and steering are also configured in a sportier way in this mode. The 1.4-litre TSI engine develops a power of 115 kW / 156 PS (as of 5,000 rpm); the electric motor produces 85 kW / 15 PS. The maximum torque of the plug-in hybrid drive system is 400 Nm. Performance and power are deployed both efficiently and in an eco-friendly way: The NEDC consumption (for hybrid vehicles) is over 141 mpg (under 2.0 l/100 km) and 13.0 kWh/100 km; these values equate to CO2 emissions lower than 45 g/km. In combination with the TSI, this results in a driving range of over 620 miles with a full 50-litre fuel tank and fully charged battery – with it, the Passat GTE covers the route from Paris to London and back without refuelling.

The pioneering low power/fuel consumption and emission values contrast with a powerful driving performance: the Passat GTE, always with front-wheel drive and equipped as standard with a six-gear dual clutch gearbox especially developed for the hybrid drive, accelerates to 62 mph in less than 8.0 seconds and achieves a top speed of more than 136 mph; in ""E-Mode,"" 80 mph.

The Passat GTE will be launched in the second half of next year – both as a saloon and an estate. With the market launch of the plug-in hybrid, a total of nine drive versions, covering a power range from 92 kW / 125 PS to 206 kW / 280 PS, will be available for the European version of the Passat. All versions meet the EU 6 emissions standard. The Passat GTE also constitutes an integral part of the strategy for electric mobility at Volkswagen. After the XL1, e-up!, e-Golf and Golf GTE, the Passat GTE is the fifth, or sixth model (saloon and estate) that can be operated by electric motor with zero emissions.

The Passat GTE is an independent equipment line. On the one hand, its standard equipment includes many features also available in other models of the range, either as an option or without extra charge, depending on the equipment version: LED headlights, Driver Alert System, Automatic Post-Collision Braking system, Front Assist including City Emergency Braking function, rain sensor and ParkPilot. On the other hand, as a high-tech flagship, the Passat GTE features several unique elements and equipment upgrades which distinguish it from the rest of the range.

In the upper section of the front end, the Passat GTE can be recognised by a specific chrome radiator grille unit with additional blue line. The front bumper was also redesigned, with distinctive cross panels in the lower air inlet and C-shaped LED daytime running lights. The ""C""-shaped LED daytime running light and the blue line in the radiator grille unit are stylistic devices purposefully deployed by Design: blue is the Volkswagen ""e-mobility colour"" and in conjunction with the C-shaped daytime running light, it constitutes an identifying feature of all Volkswagen's electric and plug-in hybrid models. When viewed from the side, 17-inch ""Astana"" alloy wheels identify the Passat GTE as a plug-in hybrid.

The interior was likewise fine-tuned for the new drive system. With a menu matrix for the functions and displays related to the drive system, the engineers and interface designers at Volkswagen TE (Technical Development Centre) tailored features such as the standard ""Composition Media"" infotainment system and the instrument cluster (with power meter) for the plug-in hybrid drive. In addition, the innovative Active Info Display with specific displays will be also available as an option for the Passat GTE. Standard details such as the blue ambient lighting, leather-trimmed multifunction steering wheel with blue decorative stitching, GTE specific gear knob with blue stitching and seats covered in ""Sevilla"" cloth with a blue basic structure have also been especially configured to the Passat GTE. Furthermore, the interior was enhanced by the ""Waves"" design (aluminium look) and ""Piano Black"" (high-gloss black) as well as a GTE logo in front of the gear shift gate.

The owner of the new Passat GTE can make use of the ""CAR-NET e-Remote"" app, by which the charging of the battery, for instance, can be started via smartphone. Likewise, all climate control functions can be activated via the smartphone. In addition, information on the vehicle status, state of charge of the battery, recent driving data or last parking position can be queried. It is also possible to check whether the doors are closed and the lights turned off.

The new Passat GTE will be launched with the high resolution 6.5-inch display of the standard ""Composition Media"" infotainment system. Optional: the ""Discover Media"" (also with a 6.5-inch display) and ""Discover Pro"" (with an 8.0-inch display) radio-navigation systems. Both devices feature numerous additional functions in the Passat GTE. They include a ""range monitor"", an ""energy flow indicator"", ""zero-emission statistics"", ""e-manager"" and – when the optional navigation system is installed – the ""360° range"" feature.


Range monitor: depicts the momentary electric driving range of the Passat GTE; the additional range potential that can be achieved by turning off auxiliary consumers that might be in use is also shown.
Energy flow indicator: this indicator utilises animated graphics to depict the energy flow when accelerating (blue arrows) as well as braking, i.e. regenerative braking (green arrows)
e-Manager:up to three departure and charging times can be programmed here, and heating or cooling of the interior can be activated via the stationary air conditioning, which comes as a standard feature.
360° range: the driving range in ""E-Mode"" is shown by the so-called 360° zone on the map of the surrounding area. The highlighted zone depicts the one-way electric driving range of the car. Charging stations can be displayed and used in route calculation.
On the left side of the instrument cluster the Passat GTE's power meter supplements the tachometer and shows information such as whether the high-voltage battery is being charged by regeneration or whether – and how much – energy is being consumed. The speedometer is still on the right side. A colour display, which is located between the power meter and speedometer, continually displays the electric driving range and the momentary operating mode. In a separate LED field in the lower segment of the multifunction display, the ""READY"" message also appears after starting the e-motor, indicating that the car is ready to be driven. This is done because the electric motor cannot be heard when the car is stopped.

Volkswagen is offering an optional instrument cluster that has been designed as a full interactive display: the Active Info Display. All instruments – thus also the specific displays in the Passat GTE – are implemented virtually. Navigation information can be shown in 2-D or 3-D views on a 12.3-inch display. Its resolution of 1,440 x 540 pixels enables extremely precise, high-quality graphics and interactive display of all details. Take the Navigation mode, for instance: here the speedometer and tachometer are relocated to the sides to make more room for the map display. Information on driving, navigation and assistance functions can be integrated into the graphic areas of the speedometer and tachometer as needed.

Data that is displayed on the centre console via the infotainment system, such as phone contact pages or CD covers, can also be shown in the Active Info Display in the Passat. In fact, the driver can find all information relevant to driving in his or her direct field of view. As described above, he or she can pull up important data he needs according to the situation at hand and then use it in an individually selected display.

Drive system – with zero emissions whenever possible

As outlined above, Volkswagen uses a turbocharged direct petrol injection engine (1.4 TSI) and a three-phase permanent magnet synchronous motor as electric motor to power the Passat GTE. Like a turbine, the e-motor revs up from a standstill and provides a maximum torque of 330 Nm. The electric motor is supplied by a 9.9 kWh lithium-ion high-voltage battery. The gearbox is an automatic six-speed DSG with three clutches (dual clutch plus disengagement clutch) that was specially developed for hybrid use. Whenever possible, the disengagement clutch disengages the TSI from the driven front axle and shuts it off – such as in phases of ""coasting""; in this case, the Passat GTE makes use of the car's kinetic energy and coasts without any added propulsive power. Volkswagen integrated the electric motor into the gearbox housing. Additional components of the hybrid drive include the power electronics (converts DC power from the battery to AC power for the electric motor) and a charger. An electro-mechanical brake servo and an electric air conditioning compressor also ensure optimal and energy-efficient operation of the brakes and air conditioner in ""E-Mode"".

Operating modes – starting in the ""E-Mode""

From ""E-Mode"" to ""GTE"". The Passat GTE can be driven in four different modes, and which one to choose is very intuitive. ""EMode"", ""Hybrid"", ""Battery Charge"" and ""GTE"". The driver can always see which mode is active on the multifunction display of the instrument cluster.

Starting in ""E-Mode"". Upon starting the car, the Passat GTE is automatically in ""E-Mode"" (except when the battery is not sufficiently charged or the outside temperature is very low, in which case the TSI takes over immediately). When a minimum charge level of the battery has been reached or when there is very high demand for power, the drive system automatically switches over to the ""Hybrid"" mode. In this state, ""E-Mode"" is deactivated, and the Passat GTE now behaves like a classic full hybrid vehicle that charges the battery regeneratively during deceleration and automatically uses the TSI and/or electric motor, depending on the situation. The charge state of the battery is maintained at a constant level in this mode. By pressing the ""E-Mode"" button (to the left of the gear lever), the driver can manually switch to ""E-Mode."" This button simultaneously opens a window in the infotainment system, in which the three ""E-Mode"", ""Hybrid"" and ""Battery Charge"" modes can be directly selected.

In addition to the ""E-Mode"" and ""Hybrid"" modes, you can set another mode via the infotainment system menu: ""Battery Charge"". In this mode, the high-voltage battery is charged during driving. By pressing the ""GTE"" button (also to the left of the gear lever), the driver can switch to ""GTE"" mode which activates the sporty nature of the Passat GTE. In this mode the characteristics of the accelerator pedal, gearbox and steering are made sportier. In connection with optional DCC, the chassis is firmer. The tuning of the TSI is also more performance oriented. In addition, in the ""GTE"" mode the TSI and electric motor work together, in what is known as ""boosting"", to make the full system power and the maximum system torque available.

Charging the battery.

There are two ways to charge the battery in the Passat GTE via the charging socket in the radiator grille. First: the standard charging cable is plugged into a 230 volt mains electrical socket. The battery is then charged by alternating current (AC) from the mains at a power level of 2.3 kW. From completely flat, it can be fully charged (100 per cent battery charge level) in four hours and 15 minutes. Second: Volkswagen offers an optional wall box for a garage or carport which charges at a power level of 3.6 kW. Using this method, the battery is fully charged after only two hours and 30 minutes. There are also public charging stations that charge electric cars at a level of 3.6 kW.

The Passat GTE will become available to order in the UK in June, with first deliveries in October 2015.",11.0,0,2047
